1,kjam206,1601866161,Bullshit. Check the stats
1,saintxLA,1601866160,"He earned the right to talk trash and the heat fan have the right to feel good tonight. They played tough and in unison while the Lakers had turnovers , missed chances and not the best defense."
1,Camtowers9,1601866156,"In the finals he was good. 
40% from 3 - game 1
42% from 3 - game 2
60% from 3 - game 3


I‚Äôd want those stats in these finals!"
1,Silver_Protection_29,1601866156,"AD foul trouble doomed us, thank Scott foster"
1,tok_sikk,1601866155,"On the bright side, this means we get to close out the series on a Friday night. Game 5 is set for 10/9. I‚Äôm not worried at all moving forward about the Lakers making all necessary adjustments"
1,aryusuf,1601866152,"‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way LeBron doesn‚Äôt win the award, everybody agree‚Äù

No I don‚Äôt. And is this really what you‚Äôre worried about after this loss?

I had AD as FMVP through two games but after tonight I believe LeBron has taken the lead. But it‚Äôs not like LeBron had an all time performance. This series going Atleast 2 more games so I think it is absolutely not a finished conversation yet.

It pretty weird to think a FMVP conversation is over after a team loss. A loss"
1,frehdeee,1601866149,You guys don‚Äôt fucking learn lol
1,tkykid91,1601866146,"I hope the coaches just play this and the Herro face during film tomorrow. I‚Äôm all for trash talk and Jimmy absolutely balled out tonight and deserves to talk his shit but...this should light a fire under them, and I‚Äôm guessing they already had one lit."
1,alphi_07,1601866145,It‚Äôs the finals ... wtf
1,thetruthgreatness,1601866142,"I saw that. It‚Äôs embarrassing. I criticism is warranted after a loss, but calling someone a bitch or whatever is just wrong. We got outplayed for the first time in the last 5 games. I feel good about our chances."
1,Asswad123,1601866140,"if you still watch pro sports and dont think they are influenced for one reason or another, then Santa Claus is real and so is WWE."
1,niknokseyer,1601866139,"That‚Äôs my fear, he has lost to Spoelstra in the past and could haunt him. 

I‚Äôm not giving up though. Hope he gets him next game and another game after that."
1,Irrichc,1601866134,"No one should be sweating. Lakers haven‚Äôt adjusted yet. Fans can complain if we lose game 4 cause our adjustments didn‚Äôt work. They can panic if we lose game 5...they can jump off a bridge if they lose game 6.

Lakers were due for a disappointing loss. We gave butler too many easy looks and we didnt go to AD as often as we should."
1,sadduckfan,1601866133,I was expecting LeBron to straight attack the paint tonight
1,genuinefriend,1601866130,"As a Heat fan, it took you guys playing really bad and jimmy butler to go crazy off for us to win. Don‚Äôt see that happening again, just happy its not gonna be a sweep."
1,orioncygnus1,1601866127,wait you‚Äôre telling me upvoting cunts begging for karma doesn‚Äôt make green better?
1,anmarci19,1601866125,Yess!!! Plus it gives us our last final game on Friday!! LETS GO!!
1,Paraagade,1601866123,Spo can coach an offense and defense. Vogel is getting carried by his 2 superstars. Switch coaches and Miami is getting obliterated.
1,__Aztec__,1601866119,Yeah that‚Äôs fair and I‚Äôm definitely a fair weather basketball fan so I can‚Äôt say much but man it seems like it happens nearly every time I watch. Kudos to the people that can enjoy lebron basketball on a daily basis
1,introvert_duck,1601866116,They're up 2-1.
1,BigK38,1601866114,Butler had a 40 point triple double. Amazing finals performance probably an all timer. He can talk his shit. I actually kinda liked it even tho I dont think the Lakers are ‚Äúin trouble‚Äù. Herro on the other hand....that made me a little angry. Hasn‚Äôt done anything all series gets a three and an and one and now he growling.
1,Glinez09,1601866113,I believe in coach vogel to have adjustment on that in game 4.. just like they did on dame/harden/murray on those switches.. Lebron should have fight on those switches. I saw him doing that on murray where he fight over screen and had mark murray on the defensive end but today he has kinda passive.
1,meekah12,1601866111,It ain‚Äôt a Lakers series win until its a 4-1 win
1,PeteyPablo23,1601866110,Yeah he just made LeBron mad. Good
1,j10kum2,1601866108,Worry about winning first. No one cares about the fmvp right now.
1,mattimus_K,1601866108,Jimmy talking in 3rd person??
1,csince1988,1601866106,He has all playoffs chill.
1,ChrisKamanUrMouth,1601866102,"No, I meant this game. They were panning the cameras to Miami Heat brass as if they already won the damn thing."
1,IllogicalStoner,1601866098,Only thing worse than Danny Brick is Danny Floater
1,jmiranda511,1601866098,"I countered the downvote you got because I agree with you. I fucking hate conspiracy theorists and this bullshit doesn‚Äôt need to extend to our sub. You can‚Äôt bitch about other subs using the bullshit ref card and then pull it out when it‚Äôs convenient for us. We lost, played like shit in the first quarter and never recovered. That simple."
1,obliterateopio,1601866096,"I doubt Spo has the balls to make that move. If Bam feels good and he‚Äôs ready to go, he‚Äôs going to see a good amount of minutes."
1,HueGoStrangee,1601866096,One is Kobe Bryant and the other is Tyler Herro lol
1,shake2323,1601866094,‚Äî Lauren Hill
1,Travarelli,1601866084,"It's kinda not really a matter of getting over it I don't think. More a matter of awe and and the fact that people like you were telling me that I didn't know what I was looking at.

So interesting."
1,yayajosh,1601866083,"Lol what‚Äôs your adjustment? Mine is stop turning the ball over and stop fouling. I‚Äôm sure Vogel said that this game. Also, Vogel has made great adjustments all playoffs. They just come after a loss. Stop expecting a coach to adjust every 2 minutes. That‚Äôs not how basketball works and that‚Äôs definitely not how coaching works."
1,NotBrokeJustBent23,1601866083,"I just want the fucking win. Finals MVP is irrelevant as hell to me. I know I‚Äôm a fan, but I really don‚Äôt care at all about that shit. I love our entire team. Except Danny Green, fuck that nigga."
1,Current_Gap,1601866076,"Lol @ the double standards. 

Did people forget about AD yelling ‚Äúit‚Äôs over‚Äù in the 3rd quarter of game 1? Lol"
1,jay902810,1601866074,Bricccccckkkkkkkk
1,csince1988,1601866072,I think he meant for the game?

1,Think2wicemusic,1601866063,The team played lazy. Had no energy. They‚Äôll be fine.
1,celsius_two_3_two,1601866061,Let him talk. He‚Äôs a competitor with confidence. Gotta respect that.
1,TheWestwoodStrangler,1601866058,Yep.  Let‚Äôs put that to bed.
1,TheWhisperingDeath,1601866058,"I mean fair enough.

He has earned the right to talk trash after having a game like that."
1,Mikimao,1601866057,"We had absolutely no game plan for Jimmy tonight.  Team D wasn't good and they were exploiting the switch onto KCP consistently.  I am gonna look on the bright side and be happy we get at least one more game of Laker basketball this season.  Nothing we can't fix for Game 4, Lakers in 5."
1,-ShortFuseSindri-,1601866055,Apparently LeBron said that to Jimmy + the Heat at the end of the 1st quarter
1,TeensiestTulip9,1601866052,Is there a razzie awards for nba finals? Danny green would win it ü§£
1,DadWorks4Sega,1601866050,that wasnt classless. everybody mean mugs or talks trash. we need that.
1,DudeWTH,1601866046,"This guy said he was gonna win last game, he's just saying shit right now"
1,niknokseyer,1601866046,^ this
1,Fridaywing,1601866045,"It literally took all the stars to align for them to win.

- stupid foul calls
- 40 point game from butler
- ass performance from KCP and DG once again
- early foul calls on AD
- turnover fest

And with all of that, it was close. Still Lakers in 5."
1,hello_taraa,1601866044,Kobe hated Dwight though
1,FartResume,1601866040,He guys..I‚Äôm starting to think all the ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been visited by green ranger‚Äù pre game posts aren‚Äôt working
1,SumoRock,1601866037,Good meme. Still was a garbage performance tonight though.
1,stuckontwice,1601866030,"I know we're afraid of 2004 happening again, but our duo don't hate each other and they don't have a Hall of Fame center like Ben Wallace. Jimmy went supernova, AD/Bron had one of their worst games, and DG/KCP went ice cold again. Despite all that it was STILL close. 

I'm nervous as fuck still, but we won't have another game like that again. It's Denver game 3 all over again."
1,TheWhisperingDeath,1601866029,No offense bro. But let them first win the series lol.
1,izzyduzit32,1601866023,Yeah they gave us so many opportunities to lead but we just couldn‚Äôt take it it the extra step.
1,anmarci19,1601866022,We have to focus on the goal in front of us. Either one deserves it MVP. But winning 4&amp;5 is the ultimate goal. Lets gooo!
1,Trojantrpt,1601866020,If Bam isn't playing I agree. But once Bam comes back (if he does) then start Dwight.
1,alexsmith451,1601866019,Surely you see the fault in this reasoning right?
1,N2trvl,1601866016,Unfortunately Kobe isn‚Äôt here anymore.  Up to someone else to do it.  We need an absolute defensive specialist on this team even if they can‚Äôt shoot.  That would have slowed Butler down tonight
1,AttemptedWit,1601866015,"There should be plenty of hate from non laker fans. Everyone else envies the Lakers success.  

They hate us cuz they anus"
1,Skyblue714,1601866014,"Problem certainly wasnt AD taking only 9 shots, or DG going 0/6 and KCP being like 1/5. It was Kuz with the 6-13 FGs and 4-8 3P"
1,LeGokuJames,1601866014,Lebron has been consistent all playoffs. The offense runs through him and I think he'll win it IF the lakers win the finals
1,orioncygnus1,1601866004,Depends on if Lechoke reappears and AD being in foul trouble
1,keepon18,1601866002,We're in trouble if we keep playing like that

1,adissimo124,1601865998,LMAO who does this 5 year old think he is
1,Think2wicemusic,1601865995,Lakers in 5
1,atlfirsttimer,1601865994,"He was hitting shots, but the slip screen Miami was doing was too easy. because there is no one to help at the rim"
1,Qmoney23,1601865993,"He has been shooting bad the entire season though, and they claim he‚Äôs a 3 point specialist"
1,DadWorks4Sega,1601865993,we would love to have a rookie like herro and his attitude. thats confidence.
1,insaiyan_dude,1601865990,I don't want to see that goddamn power ranger post on here again.
1,KobeDogg,1601865988,Danny Brick and Wayoff Pope

1,SumoRock,1601865980,"Stop talking, show us."
1,Themanthelegend8,1601865973,Can we get the ball out of his hands like we did with Murray
1,gib-an-go,1601865973,Some dirt in your eye
1,gay_porn0,1601865970,I low key want bam back in. He doesn‚Äôt stretch the floor as well as olynyk does and he forces Vogel to keep Dwight in
1,introvert_duck,1601865969,"I'm sure LeBron loved hearing Jimmy's trash talk in the end. Jimmy deserved to talk trash, he played phenomenally. I think both Butler and Bron enjoy each other's competitiveness."
1,hello_taraa,1601865969,"&gt; Yeah she took it as an insult

WNBA players do that a lot whenever NBA players offer to help. Fuck them tbh. Remember when that Ariel Powers moron got pissed at Igoudala just for referring to her by her jersey number?"
1,KawhiCancunFMVP,1601865967,He scored 10 in the 3rd after spending most of the 1st half on the bench. How can you get him into rhythm when you don't play around him if LeBron won't be the one to attack himself?
1,alexsmith451,1601865965,"The Heat just handed us our ass without Bam and Dragic, although I still think Lakers are winning the chip let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves."
1,yayajosh,1601865964,"Man, the Heat are good. They‚Äôve shown us that plenty all playoffs. We play bad and they show up, of course we lose. Heat don‚Äôt give a shit who‚Äôs injured, they‚Äôre gonna fight. We backed off and got knocked down, and couldn‚Äôt get up again."
1,bobbyawesomeVXE,1601865963,Shut up dyke
1,Qmoney23,1601865961,"Nah KCP has done more this series than Danny Green.

Even though KCP played like shit tonight, Danny Green has played far worse."
1,LeoLaker,1601865961,"In the last 8:31, LeBron James had 4 turnovers, 1 foul, 1/4 shooting and the only made shot was a dunk after the game had already been decided.

While I‚Äôm not placing all the blame on LeBron for this loss, I do believe the best player on the team, and the best player in the NBA needs to close the game for us better than this.

That‚Äôs what Jimmy Butler did for his team."
1,IllogicalStoner,1601865959,Rotations were shit as well. Playing JR any kind of significant minutes is just begging for trouble
1,GodlessKillingBear,1601865958,the fuck is this dork on about?
1,abeezy98,1601865952,Cool. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get over it. Unless he stole the 15 mil from you!
1,niknokseyer,1601865952,Isn‚Äôt it the opposite? Lakers couldn‚Äôt win without AD.
1,kjam206,1601865950,"At the end of the day, the Blazers got one, Nuggets got one, Rockets got one. Its hard to play perfect. Im not worried"
1,xprimez,1601865949,"Kids overconfident, arrogant, thinks hes the shit after dropping 30 something on the boston celtics"
1,ramalytics,1601865946,Very unlikely we see Dragic in this series. Nature of his injury would typically require weeks before he is even close to good to go. Bam on the other hand.... üò®
1,Trojantrpt,1601865945,AD didn't play the game correctly tonight. Other players weren't active enough.
1,Zeckzekk,1601865943,"It would be amazing if he actually had a message for him, seeing as he's dead. There's so much we could ask him about the afterlife!"
1,Silver_Protection_29,1601865942,Go big or double jimmy butler
1,LordBri14,1601865942,"Losing is not a problem. We lost to denver, houston and portland in the playoffs. Fans could accept this because AD played well and was actually trying out there. You can‚Äôt say the same with this game. That‚Äôs why AD is getting all the shit. And deservedly so. He needs to dominate next game and show us that he is that dude."
1,Paraagade,1601865941,We made our shots and didn‚Äôt turnover the ball in Game 1
1,OffsidesLikeWorf,1601865940,Here's a sentence I never thought I would say in my life: play JR Smith instead.
1,rokarion13,1601865935,"ok you're right the sky is falling!  Woe unto the lakers, we've been exposed its over.  Pussy ass fans."

1,ranchoparksteve,1601865930,"I hope this game gets the attention of Kuz, Caruso, Morris, and they realize that the dynamic duo cannot win without their maximum effort. They played well, but the finals demand everything."
1,Jeanlucpfrog,1601865927,"We have a lot of fans that don't realize how to behave or  shut the fuck up. Goes for every team but we have way more fans. That said, most of the rest of us aren't calling our stars bitches after bad games, so I don't think we need a lecture on that."

1,mneilson25,1601865926,"Not having Bradley in the bubble is really starting to show in games like tonight, really missing his defense right now."
1,HueGoStrangee,1601865924,Come out next game and match it Bron
1,Senor-Theodore,1601865923,Enjoy this one win. Last one of the year.
1,treyfiddy,1601865919,hoping lebron shows up in game 4. too careless and lackadaisical with the ball today.
1,alozz,1601865919,"People shat on our players in 2 qts of regular season games because they made 2 bad plays. I saw this season‚Äôs team called embarrassing, pathetic, loser, bitch etc. while leading the west basically the whole season

I don‚Äôt even consider them fans honestly."
1,SumoRock,1601865918,"That team also had much, much better role players than this team has. We‚Äôre stuck relying on old and busted Danny Green for fucks sake."
1,bench_warmer_,1601865914,"DG is 1/14 from the field and 1/12 from 3Pt the last 2 games. 
For the entire series he's 5/21 from the field and 4/20 from 3."
1,battle_franky,1601865911,"Every series we have a game like this. Not really worried but man its final, finish the business"
1,atlfirsttimer,1601865911,NBA is a team game. If Lebron didnt switch the screener would have slipped and scored and because of the spacing there would be no help. They were doing it all night which is why Vogel elected to switch at the end.
1,izzyduzit32,1601865910,Look the lakers were at about 85% effort tonight and it was still a game.
1,hello_taraa,1601865903,"&gt; She would have tried and made the NBA itself.

And she would have had no fucking chance. I mean cmon don't you people realise how vast the biological difference is between men and women when it comes to sports"
1,King0494,1601865897,"Definitely, I think one thing we gloss over is that the Lakers attract a lot of hate because of their greatness and so does Bron, its a mixture that asks for hatred, but at the end of the day its Lakers in 5 and I'm behind anyone that supports Bron and the Lakers"
1,MasterOberon,1601865894,"If you love it, why come out disinterested when he's dropping a 40 point triple double on you guys?"

1,zlendermanGG1,1601865892,"Up 2-1 in the finals we're not in a position to complain about seeing results.  This team is not invincible, losing happens.  I'm more concerned about the response next game rather than the loss tonight.  Learn from our mistakes this game then move on.  We'll be okay."
1,chubroni,1601865889,yeah this is a good description of how i feel.
1,yeeezusgod,1601865886,"Then why you letting KCP switch on him in the 4th, King?"
1,cmurdad,1601865881,I don't think they will play Bam that much even when he returns. Olynyk is just much better for them.
1,GamingReserve,1601865879,Dude had 8 turnovers. You can‚Äôt be serious üòÇ
1,Paraagade,1601865874,"So we‚Äôre going to let a guy who was killing us all game in isos... continue to iso? Either Vogel is a garbage coach, he is, or the smartest player in the game let his teammates die in isos. Which is it?"

1,yayajosh,1601865860,"Kuz and Morris were huge for LA tonight. Lakers could‚Äôve really taken advantage of that and played better. Sloppy, low energy basketball and not respecting your opponent gets you here."
1,alexsmith451,1601865853,"Lebron‚Äôs one of the greatest playmakers of all time. So why did he insist on dribbling up to the perimeter nonchalantly and just handing it to markieff to shoot a contested 3 with 2 seconds left?

Completely outplayed both statistically and mentally by Jimmy Buckets tonight, let‚Äôs hope LBJ and AD can combine for 60 next game again."

1,CRT_SUNSET,1601865836,Yeah I saw one was still up in Monrovia a couple weeks ago.
1,kjam206,1601865836,Yes why so much deferring and passing? Wtf! Bron was mentally rattled after the two travels. That ended the game basically
1,Jayymeister,1601865832,Shit happens. It wasn‚Äôt our night. Game 4 on Tuesday
1,HonestOKCFan,1601865831,what's Lebron switching so easily for? reminds me of when he ran away from the KD matchup in the Warriors series and just let himself get screened off

1,FershureB,1601865813,"Vogel not calling time out in the first quarter during that huge Heat run really set the tone throughout the game.

WTF! You're not Phil Jackson and this team doesn't have a fierce leader like Kobe to put everyone in their place."

1,aryusuf,1601865783,"At the end of the day AD is a big, so unfortunately  he‚Äôs gotta be fed. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs going to start bringing the ball up the court and running offense.

With that being said, that first quarter he got the ball but the heat defense was just swarming. Frank Vogel should have a more creative way to use AD rather than just give him the ball in the mid/high post and letting him face up. AD is talented as fuck but that‚Äôs such a lazy way to use him.

If I don‚Äôt see atleast 10 LeBron &amp; AD PnRs in game 4 I will lose my mind"
1,ApproachingThirty,1601865782,"So 500 assists 

I think 60 more playoff games would do it 

3 more Finals trips would get him close

1,PSJ123,1601865766,"Agreed, but I see what he was thinking though lol. He tried his best to get a 3 and D guy after Kawhi burned us and we missed out on Seth curry. That was the knockdown shooter we needed. Leave him open in that corner and he‚Äôs knocking it down."
1,GuyJoan,1601865765,"I‚Äôve seen a few posts like this.

He‚Äôs frustrated because for a long time he has had to play otherworldly to win.

He‚Äôs nurtured AD, he‚Äôs listened to the AD fmvp talk. It was a big game this one.

That foul on Butler when he got elbowed legit triggered him.

Was a shit game."

He only uses dwight for sparse minutes even though he's hella effective. He let KCP take on jimmy butler alone for the entire last stretch of the game which is the most idiotic thing i've ever seen in coaching wise in a finals game. Also took out kuzma in the middle of the game when he was on a hot stretch which clearly frustrated the kid.

Miami‚Äôs not gonna just lie down because of a couple injuries, and even though I know Butler likely won‚Äôt have another historic performance like tonight, the Lakers better be prepared Tuesday for a real fight.

You can say what you want about the Lakers playing like trash tonight, but don‚Äôt discount that it was *because* of Miami‚Äôs aggression on both sides of the floor. This is what the Lakers have been doing to opponents all playoffs long, and we just got got tonight. I trust Vogel to make the proper adjustments for Tuesday."

Anyway, the refs set the tone early by making it a foul whenever someone tried to contest Jimmy. So the rest of the game the Lakers defenders were pretty much handcuffed defending Jimmy. Any sort of contention would have been a foul for Jimmy. Meaning Jimmy could do whatever he wanted the rest of the game because the Lakers defenders  treated him like they would treat someone with coronavirus. If they didn't there would have been a whistle"

Most of the role players underperformed too.  Everything had to go perfectly for the Heat to win.  There's nothing to worry about.  Even if Bam and Dragic come back, the Lakers won't play this bad again.

LeBron came back from worst than being up 2-1."

It feels more like Vogel was testing rotations for game 4 then actually focusing on game 3. I‚Äôm just frustrated that once we got the lead back we settled and the one time our bench does well our starters play like trash. We gotta fix up our attitude. Our shot selection was horried and barely any movement. Also, the salty part of me says fuck the refs.

Not that worried though. We‚Äôll be more aggressive
in game 4. No need to panic."
1,slktycn,1601865527,"Deleted in a few hours lol

EDIT: just a few minutes after lolz"
1,Johnny5forLife,1601865526,"Lots of stuff went wrong tonight for the Lakers. LeBron and AD with 13 combined turnovers. AD with his first bad game scoring wise (and foul trouble) in a long time. Butler gets a 40 point triple double. It really hurts that DG can't hit a single shot. The fact of the matter is that dude is really important with what the Lakers do defensively and if he can't even shoot average from 3 he's pretty much unplayable. This is the type of game where maybe a younger LeBron could carry and try to go for 40 himself but I just don't think he can go there at will anymore or that he wants to attempt that unless it's a close out game or the Lakers' backs are against the wall in the series. Either way, a pretty bad game for LeBron by LeBron standards. 

All in all I'm not extremely concerned. I think Miami playing 5 out is difficult to defend. Miami really exploited the Lakers having to stick to their shooters like glue with switch after switch, much like how LeBron hunts mismatches, Butler did the same. The difference is it's much riskier for the Lakers to help off of Miami's shooters and Butler was going to town on smaller defenders (and frankly just about every defender). Even if Bam comes back, I don't think that's necessarily an extraordinary upgrade from what the Heat got out of their rotation tonight only because he's not a 3 point threat. Yes, he's a net positive for Miami but it's a different look on offense for them that I believe gave the Lakers trouble tonight.

The Lakers likely need to make some adjustments defensively, especially if Butler continues this level of play, but this game just proves that the Lakers absolutely cannot mail it in againt this team. Miami is capable of winning this series if everything goes right for them and the Lakers continue to play like shit in areas that they can control e.g. defense and taking care of the ball."
1,Think2wicemusic,1601865524,"Yea it‚Äôs crazy to think they don‚Äôt make every shot every time they take one....Weird that KCP wouldn‚Äôt play the exact same every game...

You could do what if‚Äôs about everything. What if they played better D and jimmy didn‚Äôt go for 40? What if they made their free throws? What if they had less turnovers? AD played soft. What if he didn‚Äôt get so many fouls? There‚Äôs a ton of reasons why they lost but yet this sub loves to blame 1 single person every fuckin time lol"

1,Current_Gap,1601865498,Lots of people said that last game too lol
1,trey0824,1601865497,Lebron and AD need to come out swinging in game 4 and set the tone.
1,CiroccPapi,1601865497,Lately??
1,ryeasy,1601865496,Butler is doing the Lebron Classic and just drawing smaller guards through switches and attacking. AD not being in foul trouble helps a lot because he can contest at the rim. If he wants to shoot fade-away twos we let it happen because he won‚Äôt be making that many again.
1,MasterPsaysUgh,1601865494,Trade AD for the old young core plus Zion

1,p321p,1601865474,Idk why Vogel had AD instead of Morris towards the end. Heat manage to neutralize AD on the floor and Vogel did nothing. Blew my mind to see Bron willingly give Butler up and let the switch happen several times. It was automatic buckets for Butler when he got the switch.
1,YellowBananaBus,1601865474,Markief is like ‚Äúi‚Äôm safe‚Äù lol
1,LordBri14,1601865472,He played like a bitch. No point sugar coating it.
1,Asswad123,1601865470,do what? its pretty obvious when refs control the game with those bullshit calls. They did it to the Heat and had those 2 BS touch fouls on Bam. shit happens all the time.

1,jay902810,1601865434,Lebron seemed disinterested. So annoyed. Those weren‚Äôt even hard screens. He didn‚Äôt try fighting through the screens to stay on him. Kind annoyed with how lebron played in 4 quarter.

We MUST make an adjustment on defense, can't have Butler going one on one and wrecking DG, KCP, and Kuzma all the time.

1,tkykid91,1601865418,"I‚Äôm not worried because we are still up 2-1 but I‚Äôm not thrilled either.

I think Bam will be back Game 4 which gives them a boost in many ways obviously, but I‚Äôm a little hopeful that he won‚Äôt play on the perimeter as much as Olynyk and Leonard hang out out there, which means we will have rim protection with Dwight. 

Tomorrow‚Äôs film session will be great. This team has made adjustments throughout the playoffs so there‚Äôs no reason to think they won‚Äôt do the same here."

1,thetruthgreatness,1601865401,"The way I see it, we played bad and Jimmy Butler had a 40 point triple double, while shooting 70%. We were down by 5 with less than 5 min to go.

Lakers in 5."

1,Jayymeister,1601865393,I wish we could host watch parties but cases are still spreading like crazy over here.
1,Unfinishedusernam_,1601865392,He froze himself out. He just passed out mostly instead of looking to score and basically just stood on the 3 point line all night
1,superRedditer,1601865390,it's the refs
1,Manmadecreature,1601865389,"I would say Kuz is our best player tonight. Offensively, his shots are on point and defensively, he is probably our best player to guard Jimmy Butler, just like he did against Kawhi. I just think Kuz is especially efficient defending players like Jimmy Butler and Kawhi, hard to explain.

Lakers forced too many 3‚Äòs tonight. Lebron and AD should have attacked the rim more tonight like in Game 1 and 2. Lebron especially should have given the ball more often to Morris for the 3‚Äôs.

Danny Green should be removed from the starting lineup.

Like I said, this is still Lakers game to use. If the players can tune their attitude and mentality just a little bit, just a little bit, then the heat will have no chance."

1,namywamy,1601865373,"I think the heat made 2 key adjustments that messed with AD. They bodied him up further away from the basket. AD isn‚Äôt a physical player and if he feels that contact, he‚Äôs gonna shy away. Second is they sent more double teams and AD is horrible at passing out of them"

1,TheShortBig03,1601865351,Delete yourself. Jimmy didn‚Äôt manhandle Lebron. Jimmy got the switches he wanted and when Lebron tried to tell his teammates not to switch they switched anyways (looking at you Kuzma).
1,The_ill_Jedi,1601865350,Exactly why I posted this.
1,ThereAreNoPacts,1601865348,Such a weak move. Dude was like 2-12 this game and makes a lay up when the outcomes pretty much decided and wants to get tough.
1,lets_talk_basketball,1601865348,I think he just doesn't wanna call his team out publicly for lack of effort in the NBA finals.
1,atlfirsttimer,1601865345,"His defense on Jimmy is fine, the problem is the Heat have so much shooting you have to switch. 

Vogel should just let Crowder stay open and have his man come and help try and recover instead of letting him isolate"

1,stuckontwice,1601865312,Agreed. Lebron and AD had like half our turnovers and AD was invisible all game. Sure he had foul trouble but that's no excuse to play so passive. Lebron was disappointing in that 4th quarter man.....

1,oneplusz,1601865304,"It's not that he was passive so much as they don't respect our ""shooters"" and immediately double him.  Meanwhile, butler gets to go at our bitch ass guards because he gets space from his team that can actually shoot. It's so frustrating!"
1,Kurtisrayne,1601865303,It's the Bubble and anything can happen like we saw with the Clippers. And they're getting Bam back.
1,SumoRock,1601865302,If they started with effort they could make up for the lack of execution. Instead they played with none and it was even worse.

1,fontanick,1601865292,Thanks I wasn‚Äôt sure how it is over there
1,HydroThermia,1601865291,It isn‚Äôt but the gameplan is if a man is wide open on 3 pass the ball. That‚Äôs the responsibility of our ‚Äú3-D‚Äù players to make the open shot. I understand that the loss isn‚Äôt 100% of their fault but if they made idk 2 3s for KCP and 1 3 for DG maybe the outcome would be different. But DG instead has been horrendous and KCP suddenly became cold
1,KobeDogg,1601865291,Fuck Danny Green all my homies hate Danny green
1,LordBri14,1601865291,That‚Äôs why ad is there. He‚Äôs a rim protector. He‚Äôs there to challenge shots at the rim. Bron is engaged at the offensive side. The least ad could do is help out defensively
1,xElectricW,1601865290,"Exactly, we were guarding him like he was Lillard when all he was doing was driving to the lane for a kick-out or creating contact. We also can't let Kelly fucking Olynyk look like Karl Anthony-Towns out there next game"

1,Jayymeister,1601865266,Everyone watching at home bro. Not really safe to be around a bunch of people over here rn
1,niconeke,1601865265,Yeah. The worst thing was that they don't have any good interior presence without Bam and he couldn't make a difference.
1,atlfirsttimer,1601865264,The opposite happened. They threw away the first quarter trying to over feed him
1,Dragon_KSM3,1601865264,He held that lip too to make sure the cams got it sheesh

1,MasterOberon,1601865233,You can't and I've stopped doing it. No actual dialogue and just down votes if you say anything about him. He has some of the worst shot selections in terms of swinging the momentum over to the other team when he pulls up from three that deep when it's not even necessary and we're trying to make a comeback. He'll also turn the ball over unforced during the moments too
1,atlfirsttimer,1601865231,"That because he had 5 turnovers. 

They will be fine. He just needs to pass out of the double faster and repost."
1,Paraagade,1601865227,He was also trash for Toronto

1,TheWhisperingDeath,1601865202,"The moment AD touched the ball, Heat swarmed their defense and doubled him immediately without any hesitation because Lakers' so called shooters were shooting bricks. AD looked like a deer in headlights whenever they doubled and either forced a tough shot or ended up with a TO.

1,LarkTank,1601865191,So true that was the key down the stretch. That and Lebron trying to hide on d and not pick up jimmy
1,HipsterDoofus31,1601865190,Not going to be easier with Bam back

1,Minstopher,1601865185,Yea humans that have been playing basketball their whole lives and getting paid millions of dollars to put the ball in the hoop when it matters the most.
1,Think2wicemusic,1601865183,"You think the lakers game plan is to depend on DG and KCP to shoot threes? Lol cmon man, that would be dumb. Kuz can make 3s, rondo makes 3s, Morris can make 3s, Caruso can make 3s. So can Bron and AD. We don‚Äôt need them. Yea you‚Äôre right that they haven‚Äôt shot well, especially DG but every time the team loses this sub acts like DG is the reason lol it‚Äôs poor analysis and the result of being overly emotional and whiny. The team is fine. They‚Äôll come back and win next game whether or not DG makes a shot"
1,Paraagade,1601865182,Not surprising for KCP. Bron kept having KCP switch on Butler and watched Jimmy kill him every time.
1,jatniknight,1601865182,He did give some good passes but overall bad performance especially the body language.

1,mneilson25,1601865136,We honestly didn‚Äôt. Very sloppy play and the body language of James kinda had the team out of it. I‚Äôm really hoping this is a big wake-up call and they will come out with high energy and urgency in the next game.
1,welmoe,1601865133,"0/6........can't hit wide open 3's, can't hit runners, can't defend.

1,vanblakp92,1601865133,"No? We had one bad game, relax. The talent disparity is pretty big, it would be an epic collapse if we blew the series. Lakers shouldn‚Äôt let their guard down, but now is not the time to freak out"
1,dogvenom,1601865132,"- Way too many turnovers
- AD's 4th foul neutered his defensive impact the rest of the game, he
was no longer swooping at people and swiping at the ball
- Butler constantly hunting for KCP and Kuzma to be switched on to him once AD's defensive went passive.  Game 1 and 2, when Butler beat his man, he'd run into brick wall of AD, or Dwight, or Lebron. Tonight when he beat his man, no one else there to contest.   
- Now with Miami's adjustments, think we need to play Howard more even if he gets killed on PnR sometimes. Him being there allows AD to do insane things on defense.

Just a sidenote, for any Shaq fans like me, here are Shaq's pt/reb numbers from every game of our 3-peat:

2000 vs Indy:  43/19.  40/24.   33/13.   36/21.   35/11.   41/12

2001 vs Philly:  44/20.   28/20.  30/12.  34/14.  29/13

2002 vs Nets:  36/16.  40/12.  35/11.   34/10

Basically performed every single game despite being double or triple teamed. This is not really an indictment on AD, so much as massive appreciation for Shaq."

1,EJ-4000,1601865047,"I'm sure tons of podcasts will point it out, but here's my take. Anthony's early foul trouble took us out of our rotation. The fouls were soft, but kinda lazy, indicative of someone who wasn't focused early on. The Lakers didn't do a good enough job to punish how the Heat were having Duncan and Herro hard hedge early to prevent Bron switches onto small players, which was favorable for us the past two games. On the other end, Butler got the switches onto small guards like KCP too often without our rim protectors like Dwight and AD nearby to contest. Do you remember seeing Butler do that same pet move of drive hard kick out to 3 point shooter? That had to have been purposeful, and the Lakers didn't stop it enough (granted we had a couple steals there). Lastly, I thought it was weird that we played small for so long. I don't think the Lakers three point shooting is good enough to warrant playing small for that long. We've had so much more success playing Dwight with AD, and it kinda sucked we went away from that, even if it was because of AD foul trouble. Those are my thoughts, but nothing to panic over yet. Just super irritated with this performance. Oh, and Bron's body language was not fun to see either."

1,mattimus_K,1601864965,only execution I care about is that Danny Brick contact.
1,lakersLA_MBS,1601864963,Yup like 3-4 turnovers literally went to no one just careless and lazy
1,boobdood,1601864963,"Naw degenerates cuz they're sucking the heat off now and stroking themselves but when the Lakers win again, sErIeS iS rIgGeD. So yea, didn't stutter, degenerates."
1,abduramen,1601864963,I'm curious why the Lakers didn't double team Jimmy today? He just kept switching and making layups 1 on 1 all game
1,Paraagade,1601864963,Yeaaaa i highly doubt Vogel calls out LeBron
1,JimmyJamToeJam,1601864961,Bron looks tired. Need to squeeze 2 more!
1,Travarelli,1601864958,You still the only one watching hoops my guy?
1,bambiface,1601864956," Jimmy Buckets was a beast tonight. He did everything tonight: play making, scoring, defending, and rebounding. Mad props to him and the Heat for stepping up to the challenge. Now the Lakers gotta look at the tape and see what they need to adjust. They need to make sure they keep the turnovers to a minimum and not get into foul trouble. The Lakers also need to find the answer when Jimmy Butler forces a switch; they can't let him dictate the Miami offense."
1,Ramstetter,1601864955,I would have punched my mother in that moment. Respect on his game but what a dumb bitch face he made lmao.
1,slktycn,1601864953,Cryin like their pantyhose is ran üòÇ
1,seanffy,1601864953,U know his night is over when hes hesitating and passing up open 3s.....
1,Unfinishedusernam_,1601864953,"AD didn‚Äôt get hot in the 3rd lol. He barely tried to get involve in the fourth. Barely tried his iso game, never got in any good positions, and just passed up the ball the whole game. Neither played good"
1,xElectricW,1601864951,It was definitely both
1,abeezy98,1601864951,"They‚Äôre a good team who plays hard. They‚Äôll take a game from that alone. 

We‚Äôll play smarter. Not worried at all."
1,EquivalentBarnacle6,1601864950,What I don‚Äôt understand is why Lebron didn‚Äôt play for like the last half of the 3rd we were down by like 9 I think? If he stayed in we woulda had a better chance
1,Hour_Insurance_7795,1601864947,"Nope, but it did.  Let‚Äôs move on and end it."
1,Johnnybebad123,1601864947,"Who is ""you guys"".  None of us are playing.  Im not out there missing shots lol."

1,thetitsOO,1601864943,Gassed? Dude played 39 minutes and half the time on offense he‚Äôs just standing around the logo.

1,FLAguy954,1601864933,"Fucking this. 

Make him earn that contract."
1,84121629,1601864932,Tbf I‚Äôm guessing anyone that isn‚Äôt a Lakers fan would want to at least see a competitive series that goes past four games.
1,majavic,1601864931,Wow are you an nba coach?  That was some hard hitting analysis.
1,Irrichc,1601864926,Thats ridiculous thinking. Imagine a player being so selfish that he has to tell another player to take a step back in a FINALS game. You guys are no different than the skip baylesses of the world.
1,obliterateopio,1601864926,"The Lakers will watch film. They‚Äôll be sure to get the ball out of his hands and force his teammates to make plays. AD is not going to play in foul trouble, and LeBron is not going to be passive."
1,HydroThermia,1601864918,I hope Mavs still want him
1,IamCG05Iam,1601864916,Hasn‚Äôt it been reported that Vogel calls everyone out
1,Aaronsun1724,1601864912,We never led in that series though. We tied 1-1 and then fell apart from there.
1,lakersLA_MBS,1601864911,Kuz with 19 points and only time he mess up D was he jump on punk fake.
1,Dudeman-Jack,1601864911,It works for me
1,TrustTheProcess_21,1601864911,Markieff and Kuz came to play tonight.
1,Skrill3xFoV,1601864911,Hes played multiple games. Pay attention
1,Hypertumor,1601864901,i can't believe im saying this but i prefer kuzma's defense on Bulter this series better than KCP and Danny Green....
1,EpicMusic13,1601864898,"Lebron's body language was just ""what the fuck"" whenever miami scored or when they fucked up."
1,madxspence,1601864895,"It happens. We almost won this one even if we didn‚Äôt deserve to. The effort was pathetic all game long. I hate the laziness. Bad games will happen, lazy games are unacceptable."
1,Think2wicemusic,1601864895,So? Sounds like you‚Äôre scared. You think jimmys going for 40 again? Lol calm down and realize they‚Äôre not gonna win every game. They haven‚Äôt swept a single series all playoffs. The loss is a good thing cause they tried to cruise tonight and thought they could play soft. It won‚Äôt happen again
1,vanblakp92,1601864892,I hope all the Heat players get healthy so that we can kick their ass and not hear any excuses about it
1,KawhiCancunFMVP,1601864892,"He bricked 2 wide open 3s, committed 4 TOs, made 1 layup in the 4th. 

He's the best player in the world, no excuses for a sorry performance like that. AD got fucked by the refs, played like ass but a huge part was they barely got him involved in that 4th quarter after he got hot in the 3rd. He also should've demanded it more. 

This game was lost because our 2 superstars relied on the bench to do the job for them. Our bench outscored our fucking starters"
1,Vintoo,1601864891,"LeBron's just so passive on this team compared to his past teams and it's infuriating to watch. He should know they almost never lose when he scores 30+, but he does nothing in the 3rd quarter and then waits until the 4th only to jack up 3s."
1,Leify1989,1601864890,"Katya ugly AF dude, her face is so fake"
1,ApproachingThirty,1601864890,"This comment put me at ease more than anything else I‚Äôve read tonight, thank you"
1,mansfieldflame,1601864889,Ok
1,mattimus_K,1601864887,Foot off gas?? more like your granddad as the pilot he drunk as fuck tryna land. With the hand full of arthritis and popping prosthetic leg.

1,Johnnybebad123,1601864883,"The way Kelly has played, I dont see how Bam makes them better.  Id much rather have Bam shooting 2's then Kelly shooting 3's."
1,IamCG05Iam,1601864882,Good. Hold players accountable. We should‚Äôve swept this team
1,AttemptedWit,1601864882,I've learned overreaction in a sports subs is normal and it's extremely unfortunate and annoying to fans who understand the game...
1,cheezylaker,1601864881,LMFAO!!!!! Thank you for this. I needed a really good laugh
1,slktycn,1601864880,"We've seen this story before, in the past 3 series. We give one then finish them off."
1,BigK38,1601864880,"Not gonna lie I think the Lakers need this for whatever reason. Every series there has been one game with blatantly bad effort. They came in tonight way too comfortable and everybody could see it. I guess they can‚Äôt handle being such the over dog. Now that fans and heat players are talking again watch how they come out next game. One major adjustment imo would be to start Kuzma/Morris over Green. Play him off the bench with Rondo and see if that helps him at all.


I mean hell I‚Äôd start JR over him."
1,alisj99,1601864879,It shouldn't happen in game 3 of the fucking finals
1,evilvyse,1601864878,"You guys should be embarrassed, Jimmy wear that mambamentality suit and showed lakers how its done. Stop using kobe‚Äôs death just because it fits the narrative, FINISH THE JOB."

1,SwerveCityy,1601864874,"I'm salty AF right now

This is the comment I needed to help me relax. For real Thank you."
1,TheLivest1,1601864871,Found another LeBron dick rider. Re-read my original comment. I never said they had perfect careers. I said there's no way in hell they would let Jimmy Butler torch their team with an undermanned roster like he just did.
1,Buffyseacrest,1601864870,It would‚Äôve felt dirty to win this one
1,morelotion,1601864869,Him &amp; Butler‚Äôs ‚Äúthey‚Äôre in trouble.‚Äù Can‚Äôt wait for Lakers response in G4.

1,deathinmidjuly,1601864864,I honestly want to more of JR over DG
1,newgodflowwww,1601864863,Im honestly starting kuzma or JR over him. I know the lakers will come back but this Danny green performance is just tough to watch. We literally picked up Danny green for this moment and he can‚Äôt buy a shot.
1,N2trvl,1601864862,I am not sure about that.  I hope you are right.  We gave these youngsters confidence and we could have one of those games where one of them hits several threes in a row
1,Jayymeister,1601864860,One of these games every series. Just make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again
1,Itz-Yaksonz,1601864859,Fr lol all of a sudden haters gonna go from ‚Äúeasy path‚Äù to ‚Äútold y‚Äôall lakers can‚Äôt beat them this series heat in 7‚Äù lmao
1,Glinez09,1601864859,good thing kuz got  Winnie Harlow now. a much more well respected and famous to brag about..
1,csince1988,1601864858,They played like ass and Miami careered it. And it was still in play for us late. They just gotta lock in on D because the Heat are more of a hassle to guard with Kelly at C.
1,Chendii,1601864857,Without checking I'm 99% sure he didn't use it.
1,6iriboy,1601864857,"It‚Äôs all good, I doubt we come out that sloppy again after a good punch in the mouth. This game was winnable, we just couldn‚Äôt get it done. AD has to play like a man on a mission next game and I believe he will."
1,CiroccPapi,1601864856,Gotta give it to Kuz as well
1,LordBri14,1601864856,You have it the other way around. Bron is carrying ad to a championship. AD proved he dosen‚Äôt have what it takes to lead a team to a championship. Lebron‚Äôs showing him the ropes now on how it‚Äôs supposed to be done
1,UrbanCrusader24,1601864855,"LOL my man was JUST about to call out DG. Hes horrible tonight, I mean everybody played bad, but to shoot 10 shots and miss them all? 

The danny green floater is legit patented to miss 100% of the time."
1,Paraagade,1601864851,"They won‚Äôt chew out Bron, who they should, or AD, so who cares?"
1,thinkingclass,1601864851,Not surprised with the lack of class. Must be the casual Lakers fans or the LeBron (but not Lakers) fans. One game and acting like they can play better basketball from their couch.
1,TeensiestTulip9,1601864849,Please. Make sure to emphasize on Danny Greens performance. 30 million for two years.
1,Hour_Insurance_7795,1601864849,"You‚Äôre right, dude.  We‚Äôre fucked.  Miami in 6.  I think we should forfeit.  I‚Äôm scared to death.  How will we match up with this guys?"
1,introvert_duck,1601864846,I can never understand that. How can you call AD &amp; LeBron a bitch when they took this team this far? Some people man
1,SumoRock,1601864846,More pissed off at them for talking the talk all night after game 2 about this not being finished and needing to keep playing hard just to come out at the start tonight and giving zero fucks.
1,anmarci19,1601864845,Players want to learn the hard way! Lakers in 5. ü•±
1,abeezy98,1601864842,"All that stuff you wrote could be boiled down to you just recording yourself crying into a camera. 

Relax."
1,UpnUpvote,1601864840,I know AD was in foul trouble but that was inexcusable. He didn't wanna be there tonight.
1,The_ill_Jedi,1601864837,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for.
1,Superalex121,1601864836,Anyone else getting bothered by Bron's body language? I saw on multiple occasions after a made Heat shot Lebron threw his hands up at the person defending. Also a few times where he punched the ball out of frustration.
1,LeGokuJames,1601864835,Just force them to stare at herros face for 30 minutes. That should do it
1,Leify1989,1601864833,"If you hold the Heat to 35% from deep it's a game you should win. 

19 turnovers, poor defensive rotations will do that, its what allowed them to shoot 51% from the floor.

In addition, can't have that while AD is in foul trouble and no rim protection without him doesn't help.

Lakers need to be less sloppy and more alert next game."
1,Johnnybebad123,1601864832,"Bam coming back means less Kelly.  Without Kellys 3pt shooting they lose tonight.  Also, Dragic coming back would be setting himself up for a career ending injury.  Lakers should attack him every possession imo."
1,immigrantsheep,1601864829,Man I could shoot 0/6 for way less than 15mil. Might even go for more than 6 attempts
1,EpicMusic13,1601864829,All playoffs. Just start jr smith
1,they_try_to_send_4me,1601864828,I swear Kobe made that face on the top against the Celtics once
1,BeChill30,1601864828,"Neither was LeBron really in the MVP race. AD was first team All-NBA, speaks for itself. Such a bad take you had, luckily it got taken down. Completely ungrateful for what AD has done."
1,eqsharp,1601864828,"Lakers playing too small. Forgetting their identity. You‚Äôre not going to out 3pt the Heat. Your game is to bruise people up in the paint and shoot the occasional 3 while playing good defense. Vogel is too worried about matching up with the Heat instead of playing to his team‚Äôs strengths. 

Also, Butler does not want to shoot the 3. This is another reason why Vogel should be keeping size on the court and making him shoot those layups over Lebron, AD, Howard or even Kuzma. Vogel is waaayyyy overthinking this."
1,HonestOKCFan,1601864818,like Lebron getting backdoored by Crowder

With that being said, we should be fine."
1,Bladex20,1601864814,Lebron and AD need to come out in attack mode from the jump. No more of this passing to DG bullshit and forcing bad passes
1,namywamy,1601864812,He didn‚Äôt use it today right? Or did I miss it?
1,hashoa6,1601864803,He should definitely come off the bench but who do we start though? I either go with Caruso or Morris.
1,AJnthewood,1601864802,Props to butler for taking advantage of the switches...AD was waiting to long when guarded one on one....
1,GTOx3,1601864801,I think we can all agree with you. Same narrative as last series. We lose to Denver and see murray shimmy. We lose to the heat and see herro and Butler get confident. Lakers just needed a wake up call and I promise you AD is going to have a monster game on Tuesday
1,lakersLA_MBS,1601864800,Danny has been terrible from 3s and 2s
1,GovTheDon,1601864799,It was always meant to be in 5 games since this is the Kobe tribute year and he won 5 title
1,OyeChico,1601864798,Worried isn‚Äôt the right word. I‚Äôm more disgusted than anything.
1,edwardpuppyhands,1601864797,"Dude, you sound like LeBron's bitter ex-girlfriend the way you've been bitching about him in this thread, and just as irrational.  Even in this ""bad"" game of his with the turnovers, he shot 9/16 and grabbed 10 boards.  His three games immediately before this were:  fantastic, good, fantastic.  He had the highest BPM on the team for these playoffs going into the game.  Blaming LeBron for his on-court play this post-season is asinine."
1,keepon18,1601864795,Coaching staff needs to get them prepared to handle the screening action of the Heat.
1,tokyoblood,1601864795,As they should. Markieff was one of the only players to show up.

Lebron played like his soccer team today especially in the 4th quarter.

1,Think2wicemusic,1601864770,This shit is so corny man. Y‚Äôall blame them every time the team loses lol shit is weak af. Watch the other side of the ball. They‚Äôre not on the team for their offensive prowess lol and they‚Äôre not why they lost.

1,IllogicalStoner,1601864753,"Lakers literally played terrible in all facets of the game. Offense was stagnant with no off ball movement to counter the zone, defense was flat footed and let shooters get into a rhythm, foul trouble, didn‚Äôt deny Butler the ball and let him run rampant to the rim, awful coaching decisions like sitting Dwight and giving JR playing time and just outright garbage energy and effort"

1,phmiller15,1601864748,Tomorrow will be a rough day
1,ThereAreNoPacts,1601864748,That was the big scheme change that clearly gave us problems. They were not letting Bron match up hunt. I‚Äôm interested to see what they come up with in game 4 to counter it.

1,juju3435,1601864747,When did he do anything like this against the Nuggets? Lol you all just be making shit up I swear.
1,renegade_24,1601864747,"This game was ours to lose. We turned the ball over 16,000 times, missed wide open threes, got into foul trouble early in quarters, did not play AD today and still kept it close.

1,Syd_The_Kid_,1601864741,Do you guys think both of Lebron‚Äôs travels in a row were valid calls?
1,ordervs,1601864740,"Lol do you understand how averages work? That‚Äôs the absolute worst measure to judge consistency. If Player A scores 40, 50, 0, 60 and 0 points, he averaged 30 ppg. Player B scores 30, 30, 30, 30 and 30 and also averaged 30. Do you understand how that works?

AD had no impact on this game defensively and didn‚Äôt assert himself outside of a small stretch in the third Q. I‚Äôm judging him as a top 5 NBA player, which is an insanely high standard. There are nights where he might be the best player in the NBA, but he also had games and halves where he doesn‚Äôt make an impact (Game 1 of the Portland series, tonight). The lakers are built around 2 superstars and he has to find ways to make an impact even on nights when his shot isn‚Äôt falling or when he‚Äôs in foul trouble"

1,johnfcknallen,1601864719,Coz they love to shit on Lakers and LeBron. Look how the tides will change after the Lakers manhandle them in 5. Butler aint dropping 40pt triple double in 4 games this series. Took them godly performance for Butler with an awful game for the Lakers to get this win.
1,_its_a_SWEATER_,1601864719,He called out the dogs with that one. Lakes in 5.
1,Johnnybebad123,1601864717,"Nah, we made it to the finals."

1,mapletree23,1601864717,"AD got the ball and was looking to pass immediately, he got light doubled all night and totally wilted, he didn't eveen seem to be trying to post up  


Just one of his 'soft' games, dude was getting pulled all the way out of the point by kelly, didn't even do anything on defense because of it and ended up -26, all the starts other than lebron who was -4 had a fat -"

1,M4rvolo,1601864710,"Butler did an amazing job tonight on switching smaller guys/better match up onto him, so it follow suit the easy way of driving to the basket.

1,CryptoExodus,1601864708,"It took a legendary game from Jimmy Butler, AD in foul trouble, and 19 turnovers by the Lakers for the Heat to win. We'll be alright. This loss was needed to wake them up. Another gentleman's sweep like 3 previous series. Lakers in 5."

1,Paraagade,1601864706,"Nah, we‚Äôre going to overreact. 

Butler can absolutely get another 40 pt triple double bc this team is GARBAGE on defense, and have been since the Denver series. Vogel is a mid ass coach who got manhandled by Spo tonight. Our offense is literally give the ball to Bron and let him playmake or dump the ball in the post to our ‚Äúother‚Äù superstar, who can‚Äôt pass out of a double or create for himself. Apparently his specialty is defense, anyone seen it lately? This roster is buns. It‚Äôs 2020 and we have a team that struggles to shoot. 15 MILLION for a shooter and he‚Äôs scared to shoot. Whole roster needs to get overhauled even if we win this series, pathetic we‚Äôre getting embarrassed by a severely weaker opponent."
1,namywamy,1601864706,Calling it a flaw is being generous. It‚Äôs his kryptonite
1,ibanker92,1601864702,"After game 2‚Äôs monster performance from AD, LeBron took him by the side and had what looked like a serious conversation.

My hunch is that people were already debating who was better - LeBron or Davis. And at the time it looked like Davis will win the FMVP. Now, knowing LeBron, he knows that will tarnish his legacy. Perhaps he told Davis to pump the brakes so he can lead. Why else was Davis so passive in this game? LeBron tried to do too much, and perhaps wanted a game where it looked like he took over. Unfortunately it backfired."

1,jenh0120,1601864689,"Agree. 9 shots and only 15 pts, really hurt them. He'll bounce back and I trust Vogel will make adjustments to fight thru the double teams and zones to allow AD to be dominant. Lakers in 5, let's go!"

At this point i'd rather have JR smith cause he literally cant shoot worse and dont give me dg defensive prowess bullshit. He keeps on shooting so its on him to stop shooting at this point. I ""hate"" this guy cause he shoots literally every time he has the ball aside from a few nice dwight alley- oop-passes.

1,FarhanWMI,1601864527,He cooked in first 2 games and whole playoffs. And previous game they decided to jack 3s instead of feeding him while he went 11/13 or something. So it became a close game while it shouldn‚Äôt be. This game he played sloppy at beginning but dumbass vogel didn‚Äôt challenge that olynyk flopp so he was in foul trouble.

Regardless though I believe he‚Äôs still the best player in the world so it‚Äôs up to him and AD to step up and be better even if Danny green is on the floor.

The lakers have demonstrated throughout the playoffs that if they get comfortable (up 2-0 or the overwhelming favorite) their energy level falls. They got extra comfy cause of the heats injuries and that‚Äôs the same reason the heat got extra motivation. Mix that with 10 turnovers in the first half, poor free throw shooting, and jimmy going off,and you got the formula for a heat win. It‚Äôs nothing to worry about.

If we keep a few more of those possessions it might be a different story. Too many wild passes in transition. Bron trying to draw fouls but ends up traveling. Rondo dribbling too much through traffic. Just sloppy. 

AD has to understand it‚Äôs going to more than what he gave tonight. A lot more. We need him. Only way we won is with him. 

KCP/DG....uhh better luck next game? I guess?

Vogel will have to adjust the defense. Especially if Bam is back. We need a big on Butler. Can‚Äôt have him shooting over DG/KCP/Caruso, he was too comfortable in the paint. 

The Heat deserve all the credit. They did what they needed to do."
1,lazybum10186,1601864403,"This will probably get a lot of hate but notice the difference between LeBron and AD vs Butler. Butler doesn't complain and puts in the effort. He encourages teammates even when they're down and his body language was confident. Meanwhile, LeBron and AD complained way too much and played sloppily. Being the leaders of their team, how the teams played throughout that game was reflected by the leadership. LeBron and AD gotta be more composed when the going gets tough."

1,itsgiancarlo,1601864380,Lebron was too careless with the ball tonight smh.
1,chubroni,1601864379,"Okay, so here are my thoughts (as pointless as they may be, lol) 

1. Lebron and AD (especially AD) did not show up today. If AD got the normal amount of points he gets per game, we'd have won this by a slim margin. I don't think he's going to let himself play like that again, and if he does...well then we aren't meant to win the title. 
2. We should have won this game, but I think we need to stop underestimating this bench. The way this team has adjusted without Bam is actually a bigger threat to our team than with him. I might be wrong about this when he comes back, but who knows. I know we have it in us to take them, but we just aren't acting like a championship team.
3. Vogel is being out-coached in this series. We need to find a way to to penetrate that zone. 3 pointers aren't our fort√©, so there has to be another way. Defense has been lame, and that has always been out strength. We need to be better. 
4. We owe Rondo a big one even though we lost. He often seemed like the most competent guy on the floor. 
5. I'm not going to say I'm worried, but we really need to play smarter. I'm not going to be all doom n gloom about it because we've lost badly against other teams before, and some people pretend like its the end of the world. I have faith in this team's ability to lick their wounds and get back in there and win it for us. 
6. I was legitimately frustrated with Danny Green today. I kind of just shrug him off because my expectations aren't super high, but he really annoyed me in this game."

1,picking4815162342,1601864372,"That look at the end of the game, when they couldn't get five Lakers out on the floor to run out the clock, was embarrassing. LeBron and AD should have had to stay out there until the game ended, since their own bench outplayed them anyway.

The entire starting lineup sucked, with both KCP and AD somehow ending up with a ridiculous -26. Every player that started was negative, while every bench player was positive, and that's how you lose games. Caruso and Morris were the leaders in the plus department, and they put Caruso out there to play the last few garbage seconds, and some were above closing out the game on the floor with him? They lost, and that sucked, but you don't end a game like that...

Ridiculous. Vogel should be screaming at them until he loses his voice. 

I think that broadcasting crew thought that this was game 7. They're probably still waiting for that trophy to come out.

Here's hoping that LeBron and AD use their poor play this game to motivate them for the next game. And please, no more ""trying to unlock the green power ranger"" or any other post that's similar. Throughout the entire game, Green looked lost offensively and defensively. He needs to quit thinking about podcasts and parades, and worry about his play on the court.

The next game will the one to show you what this team is made of, and if they can handle the momentum that they just handed the Heat."

1,Ray3142,1601864241,"Yea, way too many late rotations and bad reach fouls, and other defensive breakdowns. Plus Butler was extremely effective 1 on 1 - Heat kept going 5 out and Lakers would auto switch to give him whatever matchup he wanted, who he just lit up.

1,introvert_duck,1601864213,"&gt; Didnt even step up to guard Butler, he's always begging for a switch, to KCP of all people.

That's not how it works. Jeez

Bron passed perfectly to an open Morris for 3 when he got tripled team in the paint. Then some dumb shit with Herro happened on the other end. 

Calling your star players a bitch after a loss is such a great look LAKERS FANS. Fucking dumbasses, this team has made this far and is leading in the finals but you are so quick to call your players a bitch. Real classy"

1,CameHereforBach,1601864210,Tbh this loss might help the narrative if both Goran and bam come back for games 4+5 and lakers win in 5 - would mean lakers didn‚Äôt just win by default
1,acava2424,1601864210,That was the worst version of us. Laid an egg when we should've throated them tonight
1,LakerBlue,1601864209,I had the same thought about Butler and he showed he could do it tonight. In some ways it actually almost feels like Dragic and Bam being out has increased the burden he's placed on himself and making him play like this.

1,ReturnOfDaMACAddress,1601864203,Oof
1,Tjordan2132,1601864202,Our defensive energy these past 2 game has been pathetic
1,thetruthgreatness,1601864201,"We got outplayed. Simple as that. I feel the team let the previous 2 games go to their head and even the 1st half of this game. It felt like our semi-ok play was enough to keep us in the game, but a desperate team is dangerous. These Lakers should‚Äôve known that by now, but they didn‚Äôt. Hopefully, this is a reminder not to take any team lightly. 

Things to improve on would be ball movement and penetration. Lebron held on to the ball too much in the 2nd half and sometimes it lead to nothing (or TOs). AD needs to avoid doing dumb fouls and start engaging himself more like he did in games 1 &amp; 2. In other words, don‚Äôt get lazy and play your game. We should (and will) win if we do both."
1,Razor8517,1601864199,***LeBron trap card activated***
1,mutsu00000,1601864198,"Lebron's attitude and body language was horrible from the jump, I know he wants it badly and all that but it was upsetting to see him revert back into passive aggressive slouching and glaring at teammates from the very beginning, especially since he didn't play very well at all. The refs weren't great but he was in the wrong when he flipped out about a bunch of those calls, the Heat were just more aggressive and focused."
1,bigpappapacifico,1601864198,AD had 15 point LeBron turnovers sucked they both sucked dick but AD sucked a bigger dick

1,raydiculous33,1601864196,That's the thing. They played bad yet were still there the whole game. Hopefully and I say this HOPEFULLY... The Lakers wake the fuck up. They have done that in each series after getting punched in the mouth
1,sgtclogher,1601864193,Damn that was bad... Now heat have a chance to tie just like that. Bam and Dragic back next game we need to stomp on them like we did Nuggets

1,TheGreatLake,1601864186,"Absolutely fucking pathetic performance. That is not championship basketball. How are we gonna give up a career night to Jimmy Butler when we have Lebron and AD? How the fuck does Danny Green make ZERO SHOTS when he‚Äôs supposed to be our ‚Äúshooter‚Äù?

I‚Äôm seeing a parallel to the Denver series.

Game 1: dominate and go up big, final score looks closer because we let up at the end.

Game 2: have control throughout most of the game, let them back in it, but still win despite playing poorly

Game 3: lose

Lebron needs to take control of the ship. He‚Äôs the best player in the world, he better start acting like it. 

Lakers in 5."

1,dwedderburn,1601864185,"I don‚Äôt like the way our stars played in the last 5 mins of the game when the score was within reach. Lebron showed no dominance, he seemed like he was too busy having a temper tantrum. AD was non existent."
1,witcher317,1601864183,AD couldn‚Äôt handle double or triple teams efficiently. LeBron needs to set the tone and attack to free up the offense.
1,rich01992,1601864182,"LeBron trying to win the finals mvp that‚Äôs why lol. I remember game 2 towards the end, Davis was wide open for three and lbj completely looked him off and drove for a missed lay up instead. Davis looked pissed lol"

1,Asenine,1601864175,that‚Äôs on Frank as well as AD though. Frank needs to drill it into their heads that when he‚Äôs on the floor (especially when bron sits) we have to get him the ball. AD has to be more assertive as well. No way on earth you‚Äôre a top 5 player on the planet right now and you don‚Äôt demand the ball

1,TheLivest1,1601864143,I'm irritated at this loss. And I think for good reason. Miami is without 2 of their best players. Regardless of their backs being against the wall they are simply too overmatched for the Lakers to drop a game to this team. This loss proves a lack of focus and hunger. Series should've been a clean sweep and now it could potentially drag on.

1,BenLaZe,1601864115,must have been exhausting for Butler
1,welmoe,1601864115,Ehhh he had 8 turnovers himself (2 travels in the 4th too).
1,sinner02,1601864113,"man that was fucking embarrassing

Bam might come back next game too

Jimmy is the real deal

Lakers in 5"
1,andyUK12,1601864113,If I had awards I would award you sir
1,apexslugz,1601864113,"THEY COASTED AGAIN, THEY REALLY GOT TO STOP MESSING AROUND OR ELSE ITS GOING TO COME BACK AND GET THEM"
1,YupImaBlackKING,1601864112,"Yeah we will win, it's just frustrating. Should have had a 3-0 lead"
1,PSJ123,1601864108,"They both played bad lol. No one gets an excuse tonight. Bron had 4 turnovers in the fourth quarter. 8 for the whole game, basically cancelled out his 8 assists."
1,yardplayfaction,1601864107,They‚Äôre scared of Miami‚Äôs shooters even though they haven‚Äôt shot well recently
1,Travarelli,1601864107,What Jordan say about talkin shit when you're ahead? Ok.
1,Unexpectedfart,1601864106,Lebron played like he didn't get his wine today. Everyone needs to play better next Tuesday or this will be a 2-2 series. Heat feeds off Jimmy and if he's on the team goes.
1,lebronsburneraccount,1601864105,"oh wow 1 percent below, might as well fire him into the fucking sun"
1,roasbiff,1601864105,"Yeah slow lazy reactive defense instead of making them react to us, with blitzes and traps on Jimmy like we did Harden.

Too much coasting from LeBron and AD, which affects how hard the role players play

Bad rotations and sub patterns, I wouldn't have taken Morris out, also would have let Kuz play the 2 over KCP who was getting hunted bad in the last 6 min."
1,jimmyharb,1601864104,Bud that is going to fire up the lakers big time
1,A_Work_In_Progress23,1601864104,"Heat just hedge the pick when lebron tries to make a mismatch, and our offense crumbles the fuck apart when that fails lol"
1,easynektar,1601864104,apparently you can‚Äôt criticize lebron on this sub
1,lakersLA_MBS,1601864102,Nobody cuts when he has the ball so that‚Äôs not helping that‚Äôs Kuz and Caruso job
1,ghostbuster1230,1601864101,Happens after each loss. lol
1,PowerRun5,1601864101,calm down lol
1,certo17,1601864101,How can they play that bad knowing all they had to do was win one more game to lock up a championship? Like if we lost with both teams going all out and one team just coming up short in the end I could live with the results but we just played fucking horrible all game long and literally let them win. Sloppy and very low effort on both sides of the court. Almost like they didn‚Äôt want to sweep them and didn‚Äôt care. Wake up lakers you could have just LOCKED UP a championship! Now Miami has momentum and may get back reinforcements.
1,ParkMyWRX,1601864099,"On to the next one. Lebron needs to stop being so pouty and cut out the negative body language bullshit. He needs to lead the team and bounce back, not act completely defeated any time anyone else misses a rotation. That shit probably brought the team down more than anything Miami was doing."
1,RepPinoyExpert,1601864099,"Somewhere out there, Skip Bayless is laughingü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
1,kalbo_boii,1601864098,The prophecy was right. The Lakers are going for a gentleman's sweep. Lakers in 5.
1,Unfinishedusernam_,1601864097,He was super gassed from taking on the offensive load all game.
1,youthemaster22,1601864096,Inexcusable performance from Lebron and AD
1,Guapojames1,1601864096,"We know that Lebron can show out when he‚Äôs up by 3. We know that Lebron can show out if it‚Äôs tied. Question is can he showout when we‚Äôre down in the moment. This lost doesn‚Äôt scare me, it‚Äôs just a heads up that we shouldn‚Äôt underestimate them. The people like cry like bitches and talk shit after the game can suck my dick"
1,Zenkikid,1601864096,Butler played like Dantoni coached Kobe tonight.
1,N2trvl,1601864095,He had to play more minutes cause AD was out.
1,hustleology,1601864095,Trade green fuck it and I know LBJ pissed as fuck. He knows you don‚Äôt play around in the finals and they have 2 starters out.
1,omeryuce8,1601864094,"This is a no contest final series. It goes like 3-1, 3-2, 4-2 imo. The game was rigged by Lebron, Ad and Vogel. All about narrative and ratings"
1,-ShortFuseSindri-,1601864093,"As if that team wasn't already teeming with confidence. Now you let their whole squad take turns dominating you in isolation in the 4th qtr, and now with their guys coming back, they've got to feel like they have the momentum.

Is Vogel going to try running a zone? Playing Howard more? He's been nice with his adjustments after losses these playoffs, I am anxious to see what he does to keep that streak up."
1,LundPar,1601864092,Cry more
1,kai_123,1601864091,I still got us in 5. Butler played the game of his life today.  We just need to give more effort honestly. 10 first quarter turnovers...
1,alisj99,1601864091,That was so frustrating to watch
1,kbla248,1601864089,"Fool‚Äôs an idiot. There‚Äôs literally so many people out there they could put on the mic, that would 100x better."
1,FarhanWMI,1601864089,Fuck all those clowns bitchin about bron and AD. Can‚Äôt wait for them to lick their ass after next game lol
1,jvu87,1601864088,"We didn‚Äôt even try to break the zone from the baseline or the middle like we did in Game 2. We also didn‚Äôt even run the zone against them all game.

This game had throw written all over it."
1,KTFlaSh96,1601864087,"Keef? 

Also Lebron had 8 turnovers. That's unexcusable."
1,sKin1337,1601864087,We won't. Lakers in 5.
1,SuperBatSpider,1601864086,They‚Äôre tired after game 1 lmao
1,FuzzyBDunlop,1601864086,"You can't let any team, let alone these guys, gain back hope during the finals. Wouldnt have expected a Lebron led team to be this unmotivated, he should know better"
1,Burning_Centroid,1601864085,Yeah and AD single handedly putting us in a hole in the first
1,e-lustrado,1601864083,Lol bad take. He played really well
1,sleepwalkkrr,1601864083,"I suppose Kobe and MJ never lost a playoff game? 

Bron definitely didn‚Äôt play his best tonight and although he had lots of good plays he had far too many mistakes."
1,JMobRichie,1601864083,Call the Cops! DG stole 30 Million
1,Maza1217,1601864081,He didn‚Äôt want the ball. Granted I don‚Äôt blame him for being frustrated. Refs didn‚Äôt want him to play tonight.
1,ZimboS,1601864081,"BuT hE's GoOd oN DeFenSE

That contract was highway robbery this guy is a walking trash can"
1,MnM_Enterprises,1601864080,"Good game normal Laker fans. Fun series so far. AD was off tonight put that dude is like a cheat code 

Bitch ass Laker trolls who thought it was cute to invade our game thread during game 1 and 2... Y'all were quiet as fuck tonight. Bandwagon, LeBron Stan bitches."
1,prince_18,1601864080,Sure but he‚Äôs still the GOAT
1,madxspence,1601864079,"Yeah, almost blowing a 14pt lead and the refs dicksucking you, of course you can snarl /s.  You got like what 10 pts? You got lucky as fuck cause of the white fuccboi fraternity."
1,LakerBlue,1601864078,Yea like I know they changed up how the defended him and played extra hard tonight but I thought AD was about as unimpressive today as he was impressive Friday night. I had to check and see if he was actually playing half the time because he was so invisible.
1,jewscontrolall,1601864077,Lebron plays out on the perimeter because of Ad and the bigs. He really should go down in the post but he's always out on the perimeter because he has to be.
1,hosammbart,1601864077,"respect my ass... if a dude trash talks my team fuck him. He was better than lebron tonigh, be he ain't a better than lebron and he fucking knows it so should shut the fuck up and just play"
1,__Aztec__,1601864077,As soon as things don‚Äôt go lebrons way he gets so whiny and tries to do everything himself it‚Äôs horrendous to watch.
1,InternetShitTalker,1601864076,"They started with 9PT 8TO

that's pure dog shit performance"
1,acava2424,1601864075,"Ewww, just ewwww"
1,mattimus_K,1601864074,but he's consistently been shit.
1,boobdood,1601864074,Those degenerates are so happy heat won lol
1,hi_ii,1601864073,"Cut the the turnovers in half, we win"
1,AttemptedWit,1601864072,"I got them in 5...

That being said, we got the lebron tonight that was the lebron for a good amount of his career.... Great player but not a closer when needed....



I'm sure I will be downvoted for this statement."
1,Thunder-ten-tronckh,1601864071,"Right, so the complaint should be that LeBron didn't get enough calls rather than Butler getting too many."
1,aginglifter,1601864070,Defense was shitty on Butler. We were playing Butler 1-1 with KCP with no one at the rim. Bron should have guarded been guarding him or we should double Butler.
1,BlackJediSword,1601864069,LMFAOOOOOO.
1,G3N3IO,1601864068,Agreed. Butler was just more physical. Let's not look like those Nugget fans.
1,McLovinUrGirl69,1601864068,fucking pathetic boys
1,SuperBatSpider,1601864068,"Big respect for this chief, we can‚Äôt play the ref game."
1,bubbaloowhatitdoo,1601864068,"AD‚Äôs early foul trouble got us and we‚Äôve got room to improve. We‚Äôve gotta play smarter defense, not foul, and recognize Jimmy Buckets insane ability to draw fouls. I‚Äôm fine with losing this one. 
We will get it right next game. I have confidence in our team. Y‚Äôall need to chill with saying the team is garbage."
1,KoreanAmericanBoi,1601864067,I‚Äôm not worried either but we don‚Äôt have the brooms
1,dwedderburn,1601864066,This didn‚Äôt age well
1,Julonix,1601864066,"He put the team in position to make plays. Sure he didn‚Äôt have his best game but who did on the lakers? No one showed up aside from Morris who missed the crucial 3pter with a minute or so left. You‚Äôre overreacting after one game, just like i‚Äôm sure you did the last 3 series. We had a shit game and they had the best they could play and we lost by 10."
1,1defense,1601864065,"I think lebron told him not to go hard , lebron def wants FMVP"
1,MibuWolve,1601864065,Why didn‚Äôt Vogel challenge any of the questionable calls?? That last one where Butler elbowed LeBron was so obvious and a huge moment in the game. Easy turnover and momentum.
1,mabellemae,1601864065,"I also didn‚Äôt like how he left the court when there was 0.7 seconds left. Yeah the game was over but you should be out there with your guys to finish the last second, not running to the locker room lookin like a bitch."
1,jdot98,1601864064,I really dont get why we have AD standing in the corner watching lebron dribble for 20 seconds. AD should be the guy we go to in the 4th. He can get that mid range jumper ANY. TIME.
1,mjh13_,1601864064,Upset at himself most likely
1,bjsw534,1601864064,This. Everybody is acting like this is sustainable for Butler for 4 more games.

1,PumpsPivotsFires,1601864063,"the nuggets weren't down 2 starters

try to paint this as not a big deal if you want but you're lying to yourself"
1,CSGOW1ld,1601864062,"&gt; these games where he doesn‚Äôt show up show that he doesn‚Äôt quite have the consistency yet to be the top guy on a contender.

You're an idiot. Jimmy ""elbows"" Butler is a top player on a contender. Anthony Davis is 10x the player right now than he will ever be."
1,Miller24GOAT,1601864059,"Hope this is a reality check to everyone here and the lakers, the Heat are here for a reason. Besides that, butler talking shit is another example of Dame/Russ/Murray bullshit"
1,witcher317,1601864059,LeBron needs to stay aggressive the whole game - like what he did vs Denver on game 5. Sick of him passing it out to shooters or settling for 3s
1,RustyPickul,1601864058,You are embarrassed?  Tell me more....how did this shame you and who is doing it?  If watching a dozen strangers playing a game and having a bad night effects you personally then you got issues bruh.

1,kai_123,1601864057,Our offense pretty bad too
1,uleelee,1601864057,"Lakers just couldn‚Äôt get in rhythm cuz AD was in foul trouble.. but that‚Äôs first time it‚Äôs happened whole playoffs so I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll make the adjustment and show up next game.

Lebron.. if you are not taking over on offense, u gotta shut down butler.. it‚Äôs ok to switch but he‚Äôs scored like 5 straight buckets babying our team lol.. at some point u gotta just stay on butler and fight thru the screen"

1,Solebeast24,1601864055,"Too many boards and drives given up.
Stupid to not play big more.

Big missed opportunity but we have to get this shit together for Game 4."
1,juju3435,1601864043,Bro the only reason the Lakers are here for the first time in ten years is cuz he came here. They lose one finals game and y‚Äôall turn on him. Loser.

1,bcombs510,1601864027,Keef played well. AD won‚Äôt be held to 15 again.

1,sillymath22,1601864026,Lebron looked pissed at the end. I would be too if I got elbowed in the head but got called for a foul. Butler talking trash at the end will fuel that fire more also.

1,they_try_to_send_4me,1601864017,What does this mean
1,Glinez09,1601864016,"AD didn't got his rhythm because of those early fouls. KCP was being cook by butler because of late switches.. Coach should have bench him.

Bron was... urgh, also choke and went jacking up 3s.

Rondo won't be able to help us if 2 of our stars aren't even playing like this is the finals.

Decent game from Morris and Kuzma. we will be down by 20 if those two didn't have 19 each."

nah fuck that, we've been understanding enough up until now. 

Danny Green is trash."

1,Unfinishedusernam_,1601864014,Bron was too gassed at the end. It was literally just him against Miami for some stretches

1,UpnUpvote,1601864010,Receipts? Lol it's the fucking finals. You shouldn't need outside motivation.
1,ordervs,1601864009,He wasn‚Äôt aggressive at all. Not a single time did he call for the ball or get good positioning. Also wasn‚Äôt crashing for any offensive rebounds

AD has had a bad game or two every series but that was fucking atrocious of him, he was such a big - all night and he was invisible on both sides of the floor, he got doubled and absolutely wilted  


danny green and KCP two stinkers in a row on top of davis means only lebron was doing anything most of the night, and you could tell lebron got pissed, it's hilarious to me when he gets mad because his dribble gets higher and higher  


think that was the first game all playoffs where their defense didn't really show up collectively, butler made some big shots but there was too many free looks and layups all game"
1,Vincefin1909,1601864008,Man I doubt it Miami played better give them credit everyone had a bad game we‚Äôre not invincible I still can‚Äôt see them beating Lebron 4 times outta 7 I‚Äôm sorry I just can‚Äôt see it until it happens
1,ThereAreNoPacts,1601864005,I advise the emotional fans to take a break for the night. We talked our shit the first two games expect the same from everyone else tonight. Just remember after every loss we RESPOND. see y‚Äôall on Tuesday.

1,CryptoExodus,1601864003,"It took a legendary game from Jimmy Butler, AD in foul trouble, and 19 turnovers by the Lakers for the Heat to win. We'll be alright. Lakers in 5.  


Btw, Danny Green is so fucking horrendous. Dude is the most overpaid and overrated player on our roster. Period."
1,6iriboy,1601864003,"Butler said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in trouble‚Äù 

bro didn‚Äôt see what happened to every team that flexed their ONLY win of that series lmao. their checkout got pushed back a day, that‚Äôs all."
1,lazybum10186,1601864002,Definitely didn't deserve the win. The blame is mostly on the starters tonight. They set a lazy tone throughout the game and complained way too much. LBJ and AD didn't dominate like they should have. I hope the other players hold them accountable too.
1,introvert_duck,1601864001,What do you expect when you get doubled and tripled and then you pass perfectly to an open-man who does some dumb shit?
1,jimmyharb,1601864001,Guys this game was going to happen. The team will adjust to their scheme. They stretched it out and let butler play one on one. But the Lakers had zero aggression tonight
1,vj1096,1601864001,Those fouls on him took him out.
1,BizzyHaze,1601864001,For some reason I am not nervous at all.
1,odinlubumeta,1601864001,"I will forgive you for not remembering the argument. You couldn‚Äôt remember Lebron player a third of the season before getting hurt either. And no I am not turning the conversation. Pay attention, I was showing how the early last season made Lebron look like a ‚Äúone trick pony‚Äù. 

God do I need to make all the same points again? Just how bad is your memory? Again Magic, Shaq, Duncan, etc some of the all time greatest players and champions weren‚Äôt long distance shooters. If you think you have to be a good 3 point shooter to win, you are a first time watcher of basketball. And again is AD better than everyone I just listed? Because again they didn‚Äôt have ADs versatility. Apparently you think AD is a top 3 all time player. 

Also you need to understand what a fact is. Your opinion that the Bucks lost because one player couldn‚Äôt shoot is heavily an opinion. But yeah you should leave. You are too much of a casual fan for this argument."

Frustrating game, but let's respond with a win like we did last series."
1,jdot98,1601863964,We needa get AD the ball. Hes literally the closest thing we have to a pure scorer. Yet all we do is have him stand in the corner and watch bron dribble

Shoutout to AC, Kuz, and Kief. Those guys played spectacular. At least some of our role players showed up.

Defense on Butler was horrible. KCP was getting victimized by him 1-1 every time and he never changed it up.

lebron is so passive for some reason. and i don't think either he or ad have played over 40 minutes in a game all postseason so far. it's strange. both looked passive, but with ad in foul trouble and butler scoring at will lebron needs to put his head down and score. he was deferring all night, never turned the switch on. and had 9 ugly turnovers. 

we came into this one expecting to win and were complacent. the heat were desperate and showed that they indeed can win this series. especially if we keep playing like this with adebayo and maybe dragic coming back soon"

1,GalacticRelic,1601863912,"To respond we gotta utilize AD and have him  drop 35 next game. 

I think we also gotta dare Jimmy to shoot more 3's he's just untouchable when he drives he'll score or the refs will blow their whistle."
1,BetterCallGasol3316,1601863912,How bout 0%
1,Sheriff_IkeClanton,1601863912,We just got our heads stomped in and they have their two best players coming back and we are acting like game 4 is a lock to win üòÇüòÇ. We are going to get the jelly knocked out of us again
1,ThereAreNoPacts,1601863911,"Danny Green, I get on this dude a lot but wow. He is straight up the worst player on the floor. He got cooked for probably 20 of Jimmys points and just bricked wide open 3s that could‚Äôve changed the entire trajectory of the game. This dude is absolute ass and I never wanna see a fucken Green Ranger post again."

1,alwayshreddin,1601863907,Gotta give the Heat credits they outplayed us. Bron and AD need to be more aggressive in game 4.

1,TrueHunt,1601863901,We got too comfortable and assumed we'd win easily since we won game 2 despite a ton of kissed shots and heat almost perfect from the line. They are still a great team that we have to respect and give our best effort.

1,blank-_-face,1601863900,"Pathetic showing, especially from Lebron and AD. 

What I don‚Äôt get is, what is this team‚Äôs offense? For the last two games its been ‚Äúpass the ball back and forth on the perimeter and chuck a late 3‚Äù"
1,LALyfestyle,1601863900,"Danny, you are shit. Other than that, game was still winnable, we just didn‚Äôt want it enough. Poor decision making on shot selection, and lazy defense. Even with our turnovers, it was still winnable, which is astonishing to me."
1,cmurdad,1601863900,They made us perform poorly with their adjustments.
1,LakerBlue,1601863898,"We came out awful and had a few stretches where it looked like we were going to execute well consistently but never could.

1,vanblakp92,1601863898,Where is green any night. Dude's a bum
1,bubbaloowhatitdoo,1601863898,"KCP has worked well these playoffs and Danny Green‚Äôs defense and physicality has saved us numerous times. I agree Green should shoot better but at least he makes up for it on defense. 
Have you really been watching?"
1,JMMartinez92,1601863898,Non-existent like always. Making money just to miss almost every shot.
1,thetruthgreatness,1601863897,"Lebron played well in the first half, but started holding on to the ball too much in the 2nd half. AD got in early foul trouble and simply couldn‚Äôt get into rhythm late. 

On the defensive side of things, well the whole team shit the bag. We had no answer for Jimmy Butler and his guys kept making 3s. We simply got outplayed. 

On to game 4 guys."
1,NotBrokeJustBent23,1601863897,LeBron is better than Kobe. Hilarious how y‚Äôall wait until a loss to say this corny ass shit
1,LakersBench,1601863895,"Meh we will be fine. We had like 20 turnovers, AD foul trouble, and Jimmy went for a 40 piece triple dub. Guaranteed all 3 of those don‚Äôt happen in game 4 again.

1,cmrosales26,1601863889,"Just not the lakers night, shot keeps falling from heat, even the lucky bounce. Aint mad. But lakers played dog shit. They needed to be punched in the face tho, hope this will be the last log to force both AD and Bron to just dominate them heats for good."
1,CaliforniaGuy1984,1601863889,LeBron was pissed as hell. You could tell as he walked back to the locker room at the buzzer. He‚Äôs not going to take this well.
1,richmoney888,1601863888,This is on the coaching staff. How does Dwight only have 14 mins? Size is our advantage this series.

1,introvert_duck,1601863887,"Definitely one of the worst Lakers game this season that I've seen. Heads down, looks like people weren't communicating as well. We can live with bad shooting nights if there are at least people putting in the effort."
1,mapletree23,1601863887,"bad look from the lakers in the finals, no reason they shouldn't still win but to come out playing like that?  


AD has had a bad game or two every series but that was fucking atrocious of him, he was such a big - all night and he was invisible on both sides of the floor, he got doubled and absolutely wilted  


danny green and KCP two stinkers in a row on top of davis means only lebron was doing anything most of the night, and you could tell lebron got pissed, it's hilarious to me when he gets mad because his dribble gets higher and higher  


think that was the first game all playoffs where their defense didn't really show up collectively, butler made some big shots but there was too many free looks and layups all game"
1,A_Work_In_Progress23,1601863887,He was being fouled. Adjust and be better for game 4 thats all we can do
1,bagustin8,1601863886,Jimmy is a DOG. Well deserved W. Time to refocus for Game 4. AD was nowhere to be found tonight.
1,conwaythemachine,1601863885,Both of them have just completely SHRUNK in the finals. 7 points combined and like 1 three made. Beyond unacceptable man

1,BBA2017,1601863884,Really Danny Green? He's been consistently bad the entire playoffs
1,Renegadequasi,1601863883,This game looked rigged and like they were paid to suck typical sports entertainment
1,PitcherOnly,1601863882,"This is all Lakers‚Äô fault though. They didn‚Äôt go quick enough on the screens to punish mismatches, and they let Butler get to the rim 1v1 all night long. I legit don‚Äôt think AD contested a single shot from the help side all night long."
1,Burning_Centroid,1601863882,"Flopping ass bitch, should have used our challenge there"
1,baabaabilly,1601863882,Kuz was one of the only bright spots this game. GTFOH
1,samniking,1601863882,"6 minutes left, didn‚Äôt close. Played passively again. This one is on him. Butler was doing what LeBron should have."
1,ggnightmare,1601863881,"In spite of my recent comment, I expect the Lakers to come out with a better effort next game.

1,csboirx,1601863881,Gotta thank markieff for making this one close for the most part. It concerns me that KCP and green have been consistently bad these two games. Don't know if they can step it up in the next few

1,mamba_4L,1601863878,all good Friday is a better day to win a chip anyways
1,Unexpectedfart,1601863878,I think he only took 1 shot the whole quarter. You gotta ask for the rock and post up.
1,RunningTall,1601863878,Hope this game was a wakeup call. Series is far from over. Learn from it.
1,F0rdPrefect,1601863877,"I mean, Lebron was really the only one who did anything 25/10/8 but too many turnovers. And AD was useless because the refs took him out. And Lakers in 5."
1,KDHasNoRings,1601863877,Can‚Äôt play Kuzma when Jimmy is out there
1,youzdoom,1601863875,"tough loss , good adjustments by the heat. We just didnt come out to play. I expect James to be pissed about this one so we will see next game"
1,NanzLo-,1601863874,9 shots for AD?!
1,Jessssiiiiccccaaaa,1601863874,Ya was just ugly
1,RustyPickul,1601863874,"I never expected a sweep.  The media pushes this ‚Äúsweep‚Äù narrative and it doesn‚Äôt happen and now it‚Äôs the biggest upset of all time and butler had the greatest performance in history?  Get the fuck out of here.  All you people saying you are embarrassed.....we are up 2-1 in the finals, betas."
1,tkykid91,1601863874,"Awful performance, great Miami performance, and yet...it was still a game.

We've had one low energy game in every single series. What happened after that? Adjustments, W's. I have full confidence that AD is pissed at himself, LeBron is pissed at himself, everyone is mad. I have full confidence the coaching staff will figure out a plan after watching the game tape. 

That was a rock-bottom performance and yet we clawed back into it. Miami is tough, they'll probably get Bam back but in some ways I think that'll actually help the Lakers because he won't play out on the perimeter much so Dwight will be able to help protect the rim."
1,CellSaga21,1601863874,Hero gonna regret that snarl. Lakers in 5
1,jdot98,1601863873,Maybe if we actually gave him the ball he could be a factor
1,Hodorrulestheworld,1601863873,Jimmy and Herro really pokin the bear w their antics late game. Lakers winning by 30 next game and they not letting off the gas like they usually do
1,frenchbullie,1601863872,Defense was terrible. I cant count how many straight line drives the Heat had. Was too easy for them tonight.
1,adichandra,1601863871,You assholes expect us to sweep the heat 4-0? Relax the fuck out. We do this 4-1 through the playoffs and final. 4-1 is the magic number!
1,Anthology24,1601863871,One thing that fucking bothered me was Vogel taking Keef out right after he hit a 3 for us to take the lead. Here comes Kuz and there goes out lead. Keef come back in later and hits a 3. Why Vogel?
1,Xyph3r,1601863871,"lebron and danny green was ass. Kuz &amp; kieff came up huge offensively.

Our bench tried to carry our starters but it was too late"
1,thetilemaker,1601863871,Absolutely terrible.  Why did we just forget AD existed in the fourth quarter?  We need to get him more looks.
1,kai_123,1601863871,"Fair play to Heat tonight, they just played harder man. I got Lakers in 5 at the start so they had to get one someway I guess."
1,kenorrr,1601863871,It was very naive of me to actually hope for this series to be a sweep.
1,Virtual_Macaron,1601863870,"Ah yes, the empty stats we are at this again lmao. Watch the damn game. I am a bron fan, but this was beyond pathetic, like it or not"
1,euzen91,1601863870,Completely embarassing loss tonight. Heat are without 2 of their core players yet Jimmy manages to put up a monster triple double against them. Lackluster performance on both ends of the floor. Hopefully this will be the first and last time this ever happens to the Lakers this series.

Man"
1,Curlybrac,1601863869,We might even play better if Bam is in.
1,MFBOOOOM,1601863869,Not surprised tbh this Laker team always says the right things to the media but ALWAYS let their foot of the gas. They are talented enough that it hasn't come back to really bite them and they'll still win the series but its really fucking annoying that this team always needs to suffer an embarrassing loss like this to get refocused
1,YupImaBlackKING,1601863868,"LeBron fucked us in the 4th. Multiple turnovers which led to points and then he chose to pass to Kuzma for a long brick three. No sense of urgency. No killer instinct. 4 mins to go and you choose to pass to Kuz who wasnt even that open?

Game 4 will be crucial. We need both Bron and AD to play angry and step it the fuck up.

The bench played great for us. Scored almost half our points."
1,joseman24,1601863867,well DG and KCP were not doing shit so Kuzma at least hit shots and all that
1,vanblakp92,1601863867,"AD getting into foul trouble really threw off our rhythm. Plus him and Bron just looked lazy and sloppy out there. Garbage ass game. Throw it away, come back reinvigorated on Tuesday. Oh, and stay off r/nba cause it's gonna be a shitshow"
1,raydiculous33,1601863866,Why? It literally took the Heat to play perfect to beat the Lakers. Sometimes you don't feel like going to work. That's what it felt like for the Lakers today.
1,Paperbooi,1601863865,LeBron disappointed me in the fourth quarter
1,A_Work_In_Progress23,1601863864,First quarter was an abomination. Double digit turnovers in a fucking quarter are you kidding me? +AD foul trouble. We really started this whole shitfest game on the wrong note
1,xElectricW,1601863864,"LeBron traveled twice in the 4th, that's all I have to say"
1,sohni112,1601863864,Mamba mentality my ass

1,Reiji728,1601863863,Danny green should be benched for the remaining of the finals
1,cmurdad,1601863862,Next game they get Bam back. Really concerning that they looked so flat after Miami made their adjustments.
1,KnowledgeNate,1601863861,He can't be doing that shit. Walking out on us.
1,GarrukVonSmasher,1601863861,"Frank Vogel had the worst times off night of his life so far in the NBA. Terrible rotations, terrible play calling. No adjustments, and we didn't look focused. He's gotta see what we were seeing from DG, and AC tonight. I guess AD was just chillen...."

1,UpnUpvote,1601863860,I'd feel better if Bam or Dragic were playing but I'm just furious instead because we should be up 3-0. AD and LeBron were flat out pathetic.
1,yardplayfaction,1601863860,At least he drives. Everyone on our team would rather chuck 3s rather than take it to the rim
1,N2trvl,1601863859,Danny Green was an absolute disaster tonight.
1,AShinyTorchic,1601863859,Bold of the starters to walk off like that after playing like fucking G Leaguers
1,JulianGiraffe,1601863858,"Bron played like shit. AD played like shit. Stupid turnovers all game. Stupid fouls all game.

because they know Bam is their best player, they just had to steal 1 without him

and they just did

that's why they're so hype

this series just became a war"
1,KawhiCancunFMVP,1601863856,LeBron also played like a bitch. Down 5 and 1 min left and he wasn't even looking to attack

1,austinf5,1601863854,"Respect to jimmy for hooping tonight, let‚Äôs just come out and get this W next game and go up 3-1"
1,trappist13,1601863854,Lebron gets mauled everytime he drives. You couldnt play defense on Butler or it was a foul. The NBA did not want a sweep.
1,cvjoey,1601863854,He was sinking 3s
1,haliaeetuz,1601863853,He was -26 this game...
1,Otharp,1601863853,"They have been quoting Kobe's ""job's not finished"" all playoffs yet they haven't shown that attitude, and this has been a problem all year long, playing half assed against worse teams on paper or when they have an early 20+ point lead. I still believe we will win in 5, but you gotta respect Miami, even if they don't have Adebayo and Dragic they are a good team with a great coach."

Oh it‚Äôs a rhetorical question I‚Äôm not interested in your answer"
1,umarcola,1601863850,We can't let Jimmy Butler get whatever he wants on those pick and rolls. He was handpicking his defender every possession like it was a buffet.
1,jvu87,1601863850,"Refs took AD out of the game. NBA having the lowest Finals ratings in awhile. They need to make it interesting.

Markieff contributed big 3s. Green and KCP barely did anything.

We played lazy throughout the whole game. If we don‚Äôt get our heads straight this series might end up 2-2. 

We can‚Äôt allow jimmy butler to dominate the way he is. Make someone else beat you. He just dropped a 40 point triple double on us.

This is flat out embarrassing. We should be dominating them but we played this game weak, lazy, and unengaged.

EDIT:
aw poor guy deleted it, he initially said ""because Jimmy Butler got all the foul calls""

The lakers just didn't look right starting in the first and the turnovers ended up snowballing and the lakers had to play catch up the whole way.

1,BlackMamba1021,1601863769,"Calm down... Heat needed a performance like that from Jimmy to win, and I never even felt we were totally out of the game till the last 2 mins. On a side note, we gotta change the defensive scheme on him. Lakers in 5"
1,Bgstuxyz,1601863768,"AD needs to step up. That performance was absolutely disgusting by him from the opening tip 

Danny green needs to be able to provide just something or he shouldn‚Äôt even suit up. At least put in Dion or THT to show something instead"

1,_CallMeTaco_,1601863766,Im gonna get bashed for this but really rubbed me the wrong way they just really all gave up around the 1 minute mark and then LeBron leaving immediately before the games over. I get it hes frustrated but seeing that urks me. Eitherway with that being said Lakers in 5.

1,spaceshipjanitor,1601863704,AD played like a bitch
1,gotricesteven,1601863704,media boutta have a field day ima stay off till next game cya then lakers in 5 clowns

1,lebronsburneraccount,1601863703,34%. i said BARELY below. and yet the defense still treats him like a threat
1,DaveCerqueira,1601863701,"he has to stop switching off of Butler, just stick to the man, Miami isn't even setting hard screens"
1,XPurpPupil,1601863701,Not only did the Lakers fall asleep at the wheel but they gave the keys to the Heat and said here please run me over. Maybe its because I had a bad day but this game is gonna give me an ulcer from the sheer amount of ass that we played. This was quite frankly The Shitshow. I hope they bounce back and start playing the Lakeshow we all know.
1,ZephyrTM,1601863701,Jimmy had to turn into Lebron god mode in order to win 1 game.
1,bluedevil07,1601863701,Watching Butler run straight into people was lit

1,keepon18,1601863697,LeBron and AD looked so lackadaisical tonight. AD especially with the foul trouble.
1,kjam206,1601863697,"How many days have these guys been in the bubble?? And they come out like that!!?? I don‚Äôt understand how you‚Äôre not dying to get out of there coming out intense as fuck.

I guess we get one more ""wake up call"" game but goddamn if it doesn‚Äôt come in Game 3 of the Finals. Lebron looked straight up weird in the 4th."
1,Silver_Protection_29,1601863696,Did Dwight Howard really play that badly to warrant getting NO MINUTES IN THE FOURTH?????
1,UpnUpvote,1601863696,Great now Bam or Dragic are coming back and we let them in the series. Honestly wouldn't be surprised if they tied it up next game. I'm sick.

1,antonio0003,1601863695,Don‚Äôt even worry. It took a 40 point triple double and our worst game for them to even be close. Lakers in five.
1,Zafroooo,1601863695,Lmao Bron's going for 50 in game 4
1,Alligator125,1601863695,One team has played the last two games with a championship mentality and the other team is us. Just so disappointing.
1,JustAGuy993,1601863695,"I mean that is the series for them, they‚Äôre done after this"
1,SDas_,1601863695,We didn't deserve to win this one
1,ordervs,1601863693,"Miami came out with some excellent scheme changes. Really hunted the switch to get our smaller guards switched onto Butler. Also had Duncan Robinson/Herro hedge and recover when we tried to get them switched onto Lebron. 

AD disappeared and had stupid fouls. He‚Äôll bounce back big time but these games where he doesn‚Äôt show up show that he doesn‚Äôt quite have the consistency yet to be the top guy on a contender. Hopefully Lebron can still lead us another couple years while AD figures that out.

Not worried, we should still take this in 5 even if Bam comes back"
1,xElectricW,1601863693,"LeBron and AD were dog shit especially in the 4th jesus, we were in striking distance and they were completely passive"

Then he took a random long three. Dude gave up.

That lack of killer instinct really pisses me off. He's been that way for years.

1,DanTMWTMP,1601863399,Lebron has no post up game...
1,coachwyers,1601863397,"Only way you trade Danny Green is if you can tie his contract with Kuzma to land a 3rd star.  If you aren't getting that he is better than most role players you would get back for him because of his value with his defense and championship experience.  Yes he is frustrating because he is a streaky shooter, but his 3pt% is not bad he just goes on runs of being super hot or super cold and always has in his career."
1,thomamar000,1601863396,Kieff was really our best guy tonight
1,AncientMarsupial3,1601863395,Has LeBron even taken a shot in the last 6 minutes?

1,CutLonzosHair2017,1601862863,"Yeah, all the numbers paint him as an excellent defender. And the eye test backs it up. He's closes out harder than anyone else and moves laterally well, and doesn't miss reads. I don't know what the fuck you guys are watching."

1,Tori_kelly,1601862252,Lebron has figured out to split the double when they hedge and it leads to an open 3 or a easy layup for him every time
1,CutLonzosHair2017,1601862252,This is hitting KCP levels of dumb. He has been a great defender all playoffs. And was an above average defender during the regular season. Just cause his shot is ass right now doesn't mean all of his game is.

I really believed in this squad, and felt so sad that we wouldn't get to see how this team would have done in the playoffs.

Now after losing to Miami, I'm upset about the fashion in which we lost. 

But we swept Philly, and won a ridiculous series against Raptors. So I cannot be mad about anything - Because now I wont have to wonder ""what if?"" I got the answer to my 2 questions - ""the 2020 celtics are really good, and they are waaaay better than the 2019 celtics""

0,CjBurden,1601864604,"I mean, just before they had that 96-90 lead, Miami had an 84-76 lead, did Miami choke that lead away?  

Game 1 was an overtime game in which it went back and forth even in OT and they lost by 2.  Sure they had a 14 point lead with like 10 minutes left in the 4th... but teams get hot, teams get cold.  It happens.  If they win that game like I wish they did it'd have been a different series for sure, but thats the way it goes sometimes.

You can say they choked in game 2 I guess if you want to... but game 6 was a pretty back and forth game where miami led for far more of the game than Boston did.

Game 5 Miami choked and gave up a 9 point second half lead only to get blown out.  Chokers.   (see how stupid this is?)

0,SaveHogwarts,1601859300,"Theis is fine as a starter, our money is invested in the backcourt and wings. We lack depth and versatility. First of all, Williams needs to stay healthy. In flashes, he‚Äôs been great, but he also hasn‚Äôt had a full camp or season to put it all together. 

As far as options, you have an MLE to work with, veteran minimum deals, and a few potential trades, but those won‚Äôt become more clear until closer to draft time. 

A lot of people here want to trade up for Okongwu from USC, but I think that‚Äôs a waste of trading up. For someone as athletically gifted as he is, he graded in the 50th percentile in division 1 in terms of points allowed per possession in the paint. He has decent blocked shot numbers, but a lot of that came from the weak side, he‚Äôs not a strong man defender by any means. Offensively he‚Äôs basically a paint player. He might be able to stretch it out, but it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight. You can probably get just as much next year out of Daniel Oturu at the end of the first round. 

There will be smaller end trades on the table, and there will be guys available for the MLE and minimum. Not a lot of teams have money to spend, and not a lot of the teams that do have spare money want to spend it this year."

In hindsight, of course Griffin would have been a better decision than Hayward. We finally had our first truly healthy Hayward this season...and he wasn't healthy when it mattered most.

0,SaveHogwarts,1601854382,"Hypothetically, you get a scorer or backup point guard via trade, use the MLE on a big man, and use whatever you have left in the draft for BPA. 

Without thinking of moves, assuming Smart stays in the starting lineup, you‚Äôre going to have a bench of basically Gordon Hayward, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams and Robert Williams. On paper that doesn‚Äôt seem terrible at all. 

Romeo, even in short minutes where he couldn‚Äôt stay healthy for more than a month showed that at the very least he‚Äôs a plus defender at three positions, and offensively he shows prowess crashing the glass and slashing. We all know what Hayward is capable of, and if he‚Äôs getting reserve minutes, he can run a second unit as the primary ball handler. Both Williams have shown glimpses, but both along with Romeo are still question marks. 

If we can sign either a reliable big or a reliable ball handler to a veteran minimum deal, and use the MLE on bench scoring or one of the other needs, im completely okay drafting two players. 

There‚Äôs always draft and stash potential and trading for future picks too.

Assuming Semi is gone, and Wanamaker goes elsewhere, Kanter potentially declining his option, we could get very creative with room for rookies"

I think 14 is a solid spot for the C's, but they do have four draft picks and not enough roster spots. Would you trade draft picks for rotational players? If so, who?"
0,SaveHogwarts,1601852891,"Really depends on the price. I‚Äôve said for a while that this draft is wildly deep in rotational talent and lacks star power, but that doesn‚Äôt make it a bad draft ‚Äî especially when you can get 5 years of team control for cheap out of a guy that you can throw right into your rotation. 

Aside from Edwards, I‚Äôm not completely sold on anyone in the draft. I was really high on Deni before he shot up draft boards, but the Luka effect has him in a lot of top 5‚Äôs now. I think Okoro is a cant miss player as at least a long term starter down the line. 

Hayes and Haliburton are the guys to look at if you want a legitimate backup point guard. Haliburton might scare some teams because he‚Äôs coming off an injury and doesn‚Äôt necessarily project as a big time scorer, but he‚Äôs a very heady player with good size and shooting ability. Hayes is a question mark just because he‚Äôs international, but there‚Äôs a ton to like about what he‚Äôs shown so far at his age. I‚Äôd fee better about trading up for one of them than someone like Okongwu. I know everyone here wants a big man that can defend, but outside of his blocked shot rates, he graded in the 50% percentile in division 1 in terms of points per possession defense in the post ‚Äî he really isn‚Äôt that good of a defender even when he‚Äôs overpowering at the NCAA level. Good rebounder and athletic, and maybe the defense will come, but I‚Äôd feel just as good spending the MLE on a known commodity in terms of big man depth. 

I actually like where we‚Äôre at, at 14. This draft is full of unknowns, and the lack of a legitimate combine is going to have GMs reaching without a lot of proper research, we could see some guys previously projected in the 4-8 range (looking at you, Jalen Smith, Devin Vassell, Patrick Williams) be sitting there at 14, with a lot of guys initially viewed as later mid round guys (Deni, Hayes, Maledon, Maxey) make a little bit of a jump based on ‚Äúpotential‚Äù

Also going to throw out Daniel Oturo‚Äôs name for an end of the first round pick...put up 20 and 12 for Minnesota last year, isn‚Äôt getting hype at all. I see just as much value in him with our late pick as I do in trading up for Okongwu. 2.5 blocks per game, 70% from the ft line, capable of playing both ways and knows how to score in a few different ways."

We'd be worse than the Knicks

&gt;trading for Ky we let IT walk and had worked with developing Sexton and Rozier?

Decent I think. Maybe like the 5-6 seed. We'd have a ""big 3 of the future."" Even though I don't like Sexton that much he averages over 20 on really good efficiency while playing under bad coaches and having awful teammates. That has to count for something right?

&gt;signing Kemba we kept Rozier on a 3/50 contract and Horford on 4/110

We'd be in a bad way. Of course we'd still have brown and tatum so we'd definitely be in the playoffs, but having a washed up horford for 4 years would be terrible. I can't imagine a team would be that stupid to actually give him a contract like that....

&gt;re-signed Horford but let Kyrie and Rozier walk, w/o signing Kemba

So we're signing nobody at all to replace kyrie? Not rubio or anybody like that? So it would be smart, brown, hayward, tatum, horford? Same as the last question then basically. We'd continue to make the playoffs because of brown tatum and smart but would have no way to improve really.

&gt;signed Blake Griffin summer 2017 instead of Hayward ... Otto Porter?

0,downeastsun,1601843633,"&gt; drafting JT and JB, if in June 2016 we traded the 2 Nets picks for Jimmy Butler

That time line is dark. I think Jimmy probably goes to Miami once his contract is up and the Celtics never make it out of the east. 

&gt; ... trading for Ky we let IT walk and had worked with developing Sexton and Rozier?

Ainge never would have taken Sexton. He's taking SGA in this fantasy land and you can't convince me otherwise. Assuming Crowder's presence didn't stunt Brown or Tatum's growth I like this scenario very much. A 6'5"" point guard with a solid all around game is really the dream to me.

&gt; ... signing Kemba we kept Rozier on a 3/50 contract and Horford on 4/110

I think the Celtics are quite a bit worse this season. Horford probably looks better in Boston, but I think Theis's athleticism was an important improvement to the lineup. And obviously Terry is no Kemba, uneven playoffs aside. The plus side is no Kanter. I don't think the situation is significantly different with Horford but no Terry. Ultimately I think the offense is a lot worse and the defense is only a little better either way.

&gt; ... signed Blake Griffin summer 2017 instead of Hayward ... Otto Porter?

Assuming the Celtics keep him (although maybe Ainge would have been able to trade him for Tobias Harris + picks like LA did to strengthen the war chest.) I think he probably sucks up a little more of the shots/opportunity for Tatum/Brown; the Celtics lose to the Cavs anyway.  In 2019, the regular season might go better, but he's hurt for the playoffs and the Bucks or Raptors smack the Celtics and this season would have been much worse since he could barely play. Otto Porter got his contract matched by the Wizards so he couldn't have been signed."

You can criticize the FO for waiting too long to become buyers, but they were never trying to build through the draft. Although, I would say a lot of that criticism relies on the benefit of hindsight. Like imagine where we'd be if we had traded JB and picks for Paul George. Instead the team waited for the perfect pitch and struck out. We'll see what happens next, but I'm sure the FO knows they have to put together 2-3 superstars if they really want to contend (as others note, that's how we won a title last time).

4) why

What if we got Duncan in the lottery? What if Len Bias didn‚Äôt die? How about Reggie Lewis? What if KG didn‚Äôt get hurt? What if we kept Joe Johnson?

0,NBA_BostonGreen88,1601840835,"I think the biggest risk for Nesmith is that he really has to hit all time great specialist sharp shooting like Korver, Duncan Robinson types to be worth it. Sure would take him over Semi but that's a low bar, Semi was mid 2nd rounder and more stout defensively. Celtics system can change but right now it largely thrives when players are versatile to make the right pass, comfortable launching, and make a dribble drive for other options. Same with defense versatility. Nesmith has the size measureables but doesn't seem to have the BBIQ and instincts in his film for that kind of role. He would be better in other systems that can utilize his specialist plays."

0,NBA_BostonGreen88,1601840295,"Would love Bane at 26. He's much less athletic than Gordon but think he'll shoot better and shoot it more consistent. Takes Semi's role but he'll shoot it much better whether off the catch or slight relocation. Will be hard but a ceiling level development would be improving his handle enough to get close Brogdon level and he can become a better version of Wannamaker where he can handle some spot ball handling as a combo guard but mostly just catch and shoot 3s and attach some closeouts to pull up/relocate 3s.

Tillman at 30 would be fantastic as a slightly better version of Theis. If not against the top big men in the league Embiid/Bam/AD/Jokic types, Theis plays a great complementary role for his cost, Tillman should be great in that role too but will still need other adjustments/team effort to slow down a bad center match up again."

Twitter is by far the best place to find knowledgeable scouts. Reading their pieces and insight on prospects is the best way to start. 

Some guys you should follow and listen too: Max Carlin, PD Web, Ben pfiefer, Jackson Frank, Thomas SinCara, Jake Rosen, Zach Milner, @Cosmis

There‚Äôs plenty more but that should be enough to get you started. 

My personal advice is to focus on the translation from college to NBA. Just because a guy does or does not do something at the college level doesn‚Äôt mean they will or will not do it in the NBA. Sounds like common sense, but you‚Äôd be surprised on how much it gets lost in people‚Äôs evaluations."

I have a pretty decent idea who these kids are when they‚Äôre getting recruited at 16-17, some pan out some don‚Äôt, but it makes it even more fun once they‚Äôre nba-eligible a few years later.

The real fun is trying to get a hold on the international players. I remember being high on Hezonja and was dead wrong about him. They‚Äôre the hardest group to predict. For every cant miss guy like Luka, there‚Äôs a million Hezonjas.

0,Warlandoboom,1601836698,"Xavier Tillman's name is getting floated a lot for the end of the draft and he's a pretty great end of the bench guy to have who could work his way into the 8 man rotation. Decent athleticism but undersized. Seems capable of playing a small ball 5 as he's plenty strong, but isn't going to be able to bang with the AD's of the world. He has good foot speed though and with his motor will most likely rebound and rotate well. He also has exceptional vision for a big man and the ball moves well through him.

0,Digitalzombie90,1601833989,"I know a lot of people say its due to Bam and Dragic but hear me out. Dragic not playing has nothing to do with why Lakers beat the zone. You could say its the reason why they win the game but beating the zone is a specific thing. Dragic is a liability in the zone, he is slow and has trouble closing in from the zone to the shooters. Bam not playing does hurt the zone of course but Lakers were beating it by a large margin even when he was in the game. 

The answer was uncharacteristically given by the tv talking heads. Boston albeit extremely talented is not playing a passing game but playing more iso, turn taking type basketball. Lakers , at least against the zone, are moving the ball a lot, people are cutting and they have LeBron Rondo to make those extreme passes.


TLDR: Its not Bam or Dragic not playing, if Boston had an elite passing guard they would beat Miami zone as well."

Poirier is a real enigma, has all the tools but is just wired wrong. He needs to adapt, and if he can't do it over the summer, I think he'll be back in Europe soon. If he can, then he could be another Theis.

Seems like Wanamaker has become really popular around the league, with (for once!) pundits and fans estimating him higher than we do. I think that means he's gone.

Semi and JG feel like placeholders to me, I think they're both gone if they can be pushed out. Romeo seems like the first on the list to do that if he's healthy.

0,Nbafan1234000,1601830753,"Offensive rebounding and inside scoring against a 3-2 where they try to hide Duncan Robinson. Works against Theis/Grant williams, does not work against AD/Lebron/Dwight. You could see the impact Kanter had on the offensive end but he‚Äôs unplayable defensively. Theis is solid and works hard and I‚Äôm not hating on him but the Heat didn‚Äôt respect his inside scoring or offensive rebounding presence at all. How many times in the first 2 games did we see AD and Lebron own the paint with offensive rebounds and easy putbacks. 

For a while in game 2, the lakers actually looked like the Celtics, swinging the ball around on the perimeter and taking a 3 at the end of the shot clock and not shooting a good %. The difference was that Bam/Dragic were out, the Lakers have better rim protection than us and when they were able to get Lebron the ball in the middle of the zone, he was able to dish for easy dunks. 

The Heat used their 3-2 to dictate our offense. We took a lot of 3s and it‚Äôs hard to penetrate a 3-2 when they can collapse on the ball handler and generate turnovers. The Heat knew we had no inside scoring presence so they put all their defensive pressure on the perimeter. The games we won were games we were able to use our defense to generate transition offense before the zone could set up. 

The Celtics were one dimensional in the half court. The Heat wanted us to shoot 3s and collapsed on Kemba/Jaylen/Tatum drives. They were happy with any possession where Theis ended up with the ball and wanted Smart to volume shoot ‚Äúopen‚Äù 3s.

To say the Celtics just need a center to solve all their issues is simple minded. We need Kemba to be healthier and play better defense. We need a big man that‚Äôs a legit 2 way threat. We need Smart to dial back his usage on offense. We need Tatum to be better at finishing at the rim through contact. We need to up JBs usage rate. These are all realistic changes that we can make. One of the hardest/biggest issues is that we are paying Gordon a max contract to basically be gimpy and not available in big games. I understand everything he‚Äôs gone through and I‚Äôm not blaming him but the facts are that he‚Äôs been on the Celtics for 3 seasons as a max contract player and he‚Äôs been healthy/available for 1 playoff run. He missed 2018 completely, came off the bench for 2019 and then missed 2020 and came back a shell of himself off the bench again for 3 playoff games. We cannot get that level of production/availability from a max player and expect to reach our full potential. That is just a reality for any team sport. You need to get what you pay for and with Gordon unfortunately it‚Äôs not even close. 

Would also like to mention it‚Äôs maddening watching Duncan Robinson get completely eliminated from this finals while he was torching us. The lakers aren‚Äôt giving him any open looks and a big part of that was no Bam but also them making a point to take out Duncan on those handoff screens. We just weren‚Äôt able to do that and sometimes didn‚Äôt look like we respected his shooting at all. We let him get confident and then the rest is history"

At 30, I'd grab Killian Tillie, perhaps. He's a mobile big with a three point shot. He has an injury history but he has lottery talent. 

Three rookies is a lot to bring in, so trading up would also be ideal. The only issue I have with a trade up is whether it's worth it. Other than that, if I were the Celtics GM, I'd take the pick at 14 and maybe 26, and with 30 and 47 I'd use them in a trade for a pick next year or for a bench piece."

I don't have any first-hand knowledge or experience with any international prospects, and I'll occasionally have trouble watching any of the small school players, especially with no March Madness.

***
This year is obviously tough with fewer games and a lot of the usual info just not being available. Even then, there's still quite a bit out there. I think the best thing to do is just look at a wide variety of sources. Watch these guys play when you can and go see what other people are saying about them. 



Some places I've had success:

* r/NBA_Draft occasionally has some good resources, it can also be pretty ordinary. It's a luck-of-the-draw subreddit. 

 I've enjoyed posting a couple of word association threads on there to get a feel for how guys are perceived beyond just a simple number rating ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/fgh5jb/word_association_with_draft_prospects/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/j1vsup/word_association_with_draft_prospects_pt2/)). It's not a huge thread with a million comments, but I found it was a good place for me to start initially. You can't to scout the entire draft, but what you can do is look for certain skillsets/archetypes you feel could help the team, and having a rough list of skillsets/archetypes can help with that. 

 If you think the team needs a catch-and-shoot guy, what name are other people thinking when they hear catch-and-shoot?

* In this respect, another really great resource is [The Ringer's mock draft boards](https://nbadraft.theringer.com/), you don't have to agree with the order of the draft (and they pride themselves on being a little contrarian) but the Ringer has some of the best breakdowns of who guys are, their measurables, strengths/weaknesses and some rough player comps. It's also just really well laid out and by far the prettiest looking mock draft you'll see.

* [ESPN's draft board](https://www.espn.com.au/nba/draft/bestavailable) is probably the most reliable in terms of numbering guys in order. They're the biggest sports media company in the world and they just have the best resources. Plus they bought out DraftExpress so they have a lot of really great scouting behind the scenes.

 The actual breakdowns on players is a little light (at least in the link I provided), but if you want to know who the 10th rated prospect or 3rd rated PG is then ESPN is probably the best place to look.

* ESPN and the Ringer are my two favourites but there are other draft boards as well, the big ones are: [CBS](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/draft/mock-draft/), [SI](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/09/16/2020-nba-draft-big-board-updated-top-80-rankings), [NBC](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/2020-nba-mock-draft-170-projecting-first-round-picks-after-lottery), [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2909803-2020-nba-mock-draft-how-3-trades-could-shake-up-draft-night), [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/2103507/2020/10/02/2020-nba-draft-big-board-the-post-playoffs-update-featuring-a-shakeup/). 

 There's never a clear consensus of where someone might be drafted, but looking at a bunch of respected mock drafts can give you a good idea of where guys are expected to go.

* ESPN obviously has a lot of other resources, you just have to go to their site to check them out (some will be behind a paywall). 

 One great resource you might miss is their Film Room series on Youtube. They sit down with top prospects and talk about their game, it can give you a good sense of who guys are, how they approach the game, how they might play in the NBA. 

 Isaac Okoro, for example, gives me Marcus Smart vibes, but in [this video](https://youtu.be/aFLpH257yNg) talks about being inspired by guys like Jaylen Brown and Andre Igoudala.




* If you want to look at their stats in a nice neat format, [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/) is the #1 option for college players, [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) is the #1 option for NBA and International players. 

 Stats aren't everything there is to the game, but they can help cut through a lot of the noise. For example, everyone says Cole Anthony is a bucket getter, but actually [he shoots 38% from the field and 35% from 3.](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/cole-anthony-1.html) That's not a guarantee he'll struggle to shoot at an NBA level but it is a big red flag. Similar to Carsen Edward's rookie season with Boston, he looks like he's a shooter but he hasn't actually shot like a shooter.

 One good stat to look at is FT%. Guys sometimes shoot well in college then terribly in the NBA (and vice versa), guys who shoot well at the line in college tend to be good shooters in the NBA. It's hard to tell if [Tyrell Terry's](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tyrell-terry-1.html) 41% shooting from 3 is sustainable, but his 89% shooting at the line really backs him up.


* [The Stepien](https://www.thestepien.com/) can sometimes give good perspectives. Don't treat it like an official scouting report, they have no insider or behind-the-scenes info and even one of the co-founders will admit to that, these are just guys watching tape and giving their opinions (can see his comment on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/8raaly/is_the_stepien_a_reputable_draft_site/e0rb7bn/)). 

 For what it is, it's pretty good.

 However, this site is a mess to navigate. If you want to use it, I'd recommend finding a player you like and googling ""[Player Name] The Stepien"" rather than trying to find the breakdown through their website navigation. They have full scouting reports ([Eg. Isaac Okoro](https://www.thestepien.com/2020/02/17/isaac-okoro-scouting-report-2/)) and they also have player breakdowns and updates ([Eg. Saddiq Bey](https://www.thestepien.com/2019/10/30/draft-notes-saddiq-bey-makes-jump/)). 

* If you're willing to pay, The Athletic has quite a bit of content to look at. They have coaching polls on prospects (Eg. [Gonzaga](https://theathletic.co.uk/1902917/2020/07/03/2020-nba-draft-college-coaches-poll-should-gonzagas-stars-stay-or-go-pro/) and [Kentucky](https://theathletic.com/1919624/2020/07/15/2020-nba-draft-college-coaches-poll-what-to-make-of-kentuckys-prospects/)). As I mentioned before they also have one of the more respected draft boards around (Sam Vecenie is pretty highly regarded). Plus they have a bunch of other stuff too. 


* And then there's just watching the guys play. Whether that means: 
 * Watching full games 
 * Watching highlights from single games
 * Watching full season highlights 

 Nothing can really replace seeing guys move with your own eyes. You won't understand how big/athletic/aggressive/etc some guys are until you actually see them on the court.  

 Take LaMelo Ball for example. He's a 6'7 playmaking PG. Even just watching a [highlight reel](https://youtu.be/PdN6R1t7lOc) can help you see things that you might miss in the scouting reports. 

 His handle is incredible for his height. He handles the ball as if he were 6'2-6'3. On the other hand, he's not as strong as he should be at that size. 

 Officially, he's taller than Jaylen Brown but on the court he doesn't feel bigger than Jaylen Brown. Strength, weight, physicality, toughness and skillset can sometimes matter more in terms of size than height/wingspan. That's something you can really only see with your own eyes.

 LaMelo is 6'7 but we couldn't play him at SF, despite being taller than the average SF, he's too 'small' for the position.

***

**tl;dr**

The key I would say is to start with one or two guys. It's really overwhelming to make sense of a 60-man board all at once. The draft is an uncertain mess for multi-billion dollar companies packed full of NBA talent, that's why teams still whiff so much on top picks. You're never going to have a 100% clear understanding of the draft, no one does.


The key is not to read/watch everything on everyone, just chip away at it. 

Either find:

1. Someone with a playstyle you like/want for the team
2. Someone in the range of one of our picks 

Then just research 1-2 guys. You can use the assets I've listed (and you'll find more out there once you start looking).

Once you feel like you have a good sense of those 1-2 guys, pick another couple guys. Eventually, you'll build up a sense for how you feel the draft is shaping up."

And the possibility of Giannis going to MIA obviously has huge implications.  I also worry that Boston doesn't attract free agents.

0,downeastsun,1601822951,"I don't think it's really a fair comparison. In Game 1, the stat I saw floating around was that the Heat played zone on 4 possessions in the first half, so barely at all. Game 2 the Heat had no Adebayo so they probably wouldn't have been able to stop the Lakers if they were allowed to put 6 players on the court. I think if Miami was fully healthy, their zone could have been reasonably effective against the Lakers for stretches because they have good defensive players and it can be a good change of pace. But the Celtics started to shred the zone as the series went on and the Lakers probably would have done so even faster because of how smart LeBron is and how monstrous AD is."

0,SooooooMeta,1601820757,"Good question.

Some guys watch a lot of college ball, so they‚Äôve been keeping their eye on a prospect for a bit now.  This gives the broadest basis for a first hand opinion but can tend to bias toward how guys played in a few high profile, nationally televised games.  Beyond this, projecting from college to the NBA is really hard, so if someone has been doing it 10 years and seen how a whole bunch of guy‚Äôs careers shake out, maybe they have a sense of things.  But a lot of people just watch occasionally and form overly strong opinions based on what they see.

  Then there‚Äôs reading on draft sites and watching highlight packages on youtube.  This isn‚Äôt too bad because you might get some real scouts opinions, and things like athleticism, wingspan, size and quickness can come through pretty well, which give you some sense of the upper potential of a player.  And physical traits and ‚Äúceiling‚Äù are so important in an NBA player that you‚Äôd rather miss on four mid first round picks completely and get one star than get five okay players."

Personally, I think Maxey would be perfect long term. Kira is a PG that makes sense too who can play off our wings. If neither of those are available, Hampton or Poku are two high upside, boom or bust players that I wouldn't mind taking a chance upon. 14 is pretty high for Anthony, but he could definitely be picked at one of the later picks if he's available."

Tillman is a savvy big man, probably the best passer of the draft as a big. Good decision making and super efficient off the roll. His outsode shooting needs some improvement though. Also not the greatest athlete but he makes up for it with he's great instinct and anticipation on defense."

 Both Brown and Tatum need to be our lead scorers as well as they need to improve their playmaking. We also need to work on our shot selection on the offensive end as we took too many bad shots and relied heavily on ISO plays.

Ainge also needs to improve the veteran depth of our team - too many young players on our bench. We played like a young team in crunch time, chucking too many 3s early in the shot clock trying to get back the lead in the 4th quarter, when we should have been attacking at the rim. Vets that can calm our young players down during crunch time is needed to guide us, like Igoudala and Haslem did with the heat.

Our path to a title is 100% contingent on the J‚Äôs continuing to develop into stars, but that‚Äôs not a bad thing. They‚Äôve already carried us to two ECFs and are trending the right way.

Hopefully Kanter takes his player option, that way we can at least have a back up center and someone to include in trades. If not, hope him the best wherever he goes.

Let Javonte Green go, or take his option, doesn't really matter because he's the 15th guy. Think Tatum is close with him so maybe it's worth keeping him. 

Keep Waters on a small and short deal, he's decent but undersized so it's worth seeing if he can develop more. Personally wish we could keep him on a two-way but maybe he's not interested in that. 

Tacko's a fun guy to watch, and memes aside I think he has a really good mindset as a person and a player. Both him and Brown seem like really smart guys who pick things up easily. Given his physical tools, I'd give him a roster spot and see if he can improve from here on out. Ideal scenario would be that he develops into a Boban type of player who you can play every now and then for a few minutes a game. 

Pick up Ojeleye's club option, but man I really hope we can include him as filler in a trade eventually. If not, I wouldn't lose any sleep over us waiving him. Someone will probably pick him up as a deep bench guy so preferably I'd want to trade him.

Trade Poirier or dump his contract with a 2nd round pick. Really awful signing by Ainge and I have yet to figure out why we signed his trash ass."

""The Celtics couldn't beat the zone"" is one of those things that gets repeated a lot but isn't really true. 

Our best quarter of the series came against the zone. We won G5 off the back of Miami playing zone in the 3rd quarter and Boston winning that quarter by ~20 points.

If the zone was working as well as everyone said, Miami wouldn't have started using it less and less. 

LA is better at beating the zone than Boston, but it's less about Boston not being able to figure out the zone and more about LA being perfectly built to beat the zone.

1. One of the best ways to beat the zone is to pass to someone on the FT line and collapse it from the inside - AD is a much bigger threat on the FT line than Theis 
2. You can also power your way through the zone (which is why Jaylen was so good) - LeBron is the greatest driving threat in the history of the NBA
3. The Celtics had lots of sloppy possessions that cost them the games - LeBron and Rondo don't waste many possessions when they're locked in.

Plus what the others have said."

Signing ring chasers doesn't ""fill out your roster"" at all and that is not a viable way to win a chip no matter who is at the helm.  


Let's also go with the hyper realistic assumption of LeBron not slowing down, you'd have him and AD, both Top 5 (at the least) players, but with no supporting cast? Bench warmers that would get at most 5 minutes a night would be starters for them. LeBron running PG and AD running PF/C would leave them with no wings, and no shooting IF you're signing any bench warmers.  


Best case scneario for them is that they can get Kuz back and trade him for some more players, players like JaVale, Avery Bradley, Jared Dudley, Rondo and some more players that they trade for is not going to be a championship winning team with the rise of the Nuggets, the OKC Thunder with all their assets, the Suns, the return of the HEALTHY warriors, the Grizzlies, the Mavs with Luka and KP (hopefully healthy), and possibly the Pels by then.   


Sure the Lakers can be great in the West with LeBron being arguable the goat, but the Western Conference is certainly not going to back down to the Lakers and will fight guaranteed.

He led the Euroleague in rebounding in 2019, and was all euro league second team the same year. I‚Äôm not ready to call him a lost cause on that cheap of a deal"

The box scores looked very heavily in favor of those 6 and there weren‚Äôt a lot of minutes beyond that.  Kanter did get some but still pretty limited.

&gt; on ball creator 

On this, I'd say we have already seen a pretty big jump from Jaylen this year. Just not necessarily in the half-court. 

[When Kobe did his detail ep on Jaylen](https://twitter.com/FCHWPO/status/1000053881882193920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1000053881882193920%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.masslive.com%2Fceltics%2F2018%2F05%2Fboston_celtics_jaylen_brown_ge.html), one of the big areas of improvement he listed was pushing the pace in the full-court. He specifically suggested Brown should start watching more clips of Allen Iverson. 

This season, I'd say Brown was our best on-ball transition creator, both for himself and others. He's filled the grab-and-go role Rozier used to play for us. A lot of the other guys take their time getting the ball up the court, when Brown grabs the rebound he pushes the pace and that creates opportunities.

It's not just when he runs the floor and attacks defenders on the back foot, those [full-court bounce passes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-rh7kMfbVs) he's been showing off this season are very [Iverson-esque](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1sKWskkEr4)."

Brown and Tatum will get max deals and when Kemba reaches final year there can be yet another trade of big contracts for talent.

What we have seen with other super teams is that solid vets are willing to take less money to join a team if it is close to a championship and this team has all the right ingredients for it.

While I see the possibilities of a bright future, it's hard for me to not see the inverse which is we lose everybody for nothing and have to start tanking to rebuild in 2-3 years. The team's roster management philosophy over the past few years has been to pay people their past ceiling, with little regard for future cap space. This has, for the most part, worked to deliver results in the short term, but I worry about what this looks like in a few years.

Yeh, but no other point guard or player could ever replicate a LeBron.. So that's the point. Take LeBron out, and the Lakers would be a lesser version of that Pelicans team. 

&gt;

LeBron WITH AD.. is what makes all the difference. Plus, far too many people still didn't expect LeBron to be the best in the world even at age 35, and dominate the WEST now as well.. The dude is somehow only getting better, scarier.. even more of a cold blooded killer. 

&gt;

LeBron and AD's chemistry on and off the court is also the difference maker. AD just didn't go to the Lakers, for the sake of it. He WANTED to be with LeBron, and play with him.. That's why they already have such insane chemistry.. Everything seems too effortless 

&gt;


Chemistry is so fuckin important. Look at the Clippers, and how they completely choked and self destructed under pressure. That's the lack of chemistry, and leadership. They have all the talent on paper, and even arguably got the deepest team. And yet.. they looked completely lost and broken

Our wings can take us 75% of the way there but they desperately need help on the interior. We need a talent boost at the 5 and staying put while cause us to stagnate. Theis was supposed to be a stop gap not the answer to bank on for the future of our frontcourt. No Myles Turner is not gonna stop Embiid and the elite big men but he can keep his matchup alot closer than Theis can as his man drops 25 and 10 after fouling out with 8 points and 9 boards. Turner would put up more like an efficient 15 and 10 + 3 BLKs and 1.5 3PM consistently while softening the other guy's impact. 

I truly believe he'd be an improved passer, shooter, scorer and defender in our system and around our talent and give us that bump in confidence and up the intimidation factor. Rather than a backup, we'd have no holes in star power 1-5.

If you think Tatum on the Mavs would be the same production you‚Äôre crazy man. Luke‚Äôs penetration ability is so far above Tatums. He‚Äôs top 5 in the league at getting inside, which allows him to control every aspect of the game. He‚Äôs a Lebron in the sense that he is able to control the game, it plays at his pace. 

Tatum is 100% not a superstar. These are the superstars in the league: Bron, AD, Harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Joker, Lillard, and Luka. Tatum is not at the level of any of those players.

You are absolutely delusional if you think it is close. Luka is 21 on First Team All NBA. Luka, baring injury is going to be the best player in the league at some point. Do you really think Tatum will be the best player in the NBA? He‚Äôs not even top 10 at the moment while Luka is. 

It is not even close and anyone that knows the modern NBA will tell you that. Luka is a wet dream for coaches because of his ability to control the game like few can. I can not state that enough.

The mavs have porzingis, not to mention three more 12+ ppg scorers, so to act as if luka has the ball in his hands all the time compared to Tatum is disingenuous. Also tatums usage rate was slightly below 30% while Lukas was hovering around 35%.

In my opinion, what absolutely has screwed the last 4 years of this franchise in going to the finals was Gordon Hayward‚Äôs injury, and that‚Äôs ok, but we absolutely cannot forget the fact that JT is 22 and JB is 23. To expect these 2 to lead you to a conference finals at that age is pretty absurd. Our window is ballistic, and we know for a hard fact we have Jaylen and Jayson together for a minimum of 5 years, and what‚Äôs crazy, is that in 5 years that might not even be the best those 2 guys can be. A lot of guys start playing their best ball at 30. Middleton, Harden, Kawhi, Buckets are all around 30 years old. In 5 years, the Jays will be younger than those guys are right now. We MUST keep these 2 together unless a freakish trade comes up Jaylen Brown. Even Siakam is 26 and just had his breakout year. I think the next 5 years for this franchise is going to be ridiculous. When Kembas contract is over, they‚Äôll be 26 and 25 respectively. Is it wrong to think they are still ‚Äúyoung‚Äù to compete for a championship at that age? Can you imagine the other younger talent we can have developed by then? I honestly think we have a young Spurs on our hands ... maybe that‚Äôs just me.

Also, the only thing that will fuck this up is if ownership turns into OKC and cheaps out ... and I promise you, that is not going to happen. We must be patient. It sucks because we are absolutely good enough to get to the finals right now. Just remember, the Warriors made their first finals with Curry when he was 27. They were good for about 2 years before that. Our window is absurd with these guys because they are so young."

You only need step backs, for the most part, when you have the ball and initiate the offense at the top of the key when going one on one. It's used to create separation. Since he's not trusted to do this due to his handle and BBIQ and also because we have several players who can, ahead of him, I don't see how this helps his game that much. If I'm him, beyond the obvious handle improvements, I'd continue to work on my pull-up game that he's already showing with great success. This will allow him to fake three point shots when contested, then drive and pull-up for a midrange jumper, or when help arrives, to dish for the assist. He did this twice in the playoffs but they were long twos and I hate those. I'm talking 12-15 footers. Maybe even develop a floater as well."

0,downeastsun,1601760273,"&gt; Toronto did it last year with Kawhi and Gasol trades, Lakers said fuck them kids and got AD

Kawhi cost the Raptors nothing. For the Celtics, the rumor was that it would have taken Jaylen and Smart in a sign and trade. Does Kyrie/Kawhi/last year's Hayward/Tatum/Horford with Rozier/Baynes/Morris off the bench win the championship? Maybe but it's not a certainty. I'm at peace with passing on him.

It seems like Kyrie was already committed to leaving by the time the Celtics could trade for AD due to the Rose Rule. And honestly I think it might have taken Tatum and Brown to beat LA's offer. I don't think Brown's stock was that high around the league last year (Probably lower than Lonzo and Ingram's) and the Celtics had the 14 pick instead of the 4th. Or maybe they take Smart instead. If free agency played out the same, do you think Kemba/Smart or Brown/Hayward/AD/Theis wins the title? I think that's a hell of a risk and AD could very well walk regardless.

Honestly, you could argue that Ainge should have played the long view even more and not cashed in a Brooklyn pick for Kyrie. I think it was a decent trade, but the Celtics only got one shitty playoffs from Kyrie and lost the chance to pick up somebody like SGA in the 2018 draft. In any case, I don't think there are any sacred cows in the Celtics war chest. If Ainge thinks a trade will improve the team, he'll make it, but I honestly don't think he's passed on any obvious moves based on the rumored costs."

On court vision can be improved with lots of filmwork. Knowing what others will do before they do it........and using the eyes to confirm what you suspect will happen, versus ""looking"" to see what will happen.

it will mean greater focus on basketball vs other activities!

2) I want Brown to improve his handle especially with his left hand!"
0,shinyjolteon1,1601758405,"1. His team defense, Jaylen is probably one of the best one on one defenders in the league, but he gets lost (badly) occasionally and it got abused in the playoffs at times. I honestly don't know if that is something he can work on too much in the offseason especially with COVID and it might be something he needs to focus more on in camp/preseason/during the season

2. Passing. On offense, Jaylen is a monster in the two main areas that the modern game wants players to use to score- he is close to deadeye (as it gets for a NBA player) from the corner with his 3's and his power in his driving abuses all but big men and the best wing defenders at the basket with a very good turnaround fadeaway that I swear he shoots 70% with if the defender is one of the few who can stay with him. His passing is what he needs to improve to be a complete modern player on the offensive end- when he goes into his little slash, drive, turnaround mode he rarely looks to pass and that is reflected in his assist stat. I don't want to discourage him from driving or taking shots because he makes them but I would like him to look for others more often, just like I want the other guys to give him the ball more especially when he is hot and aggressive 

3. Handles, his biggest issue early in his career is by no means a weakness now, but with the massive strides he has already taken, I would like to see him go from adequate/good to great. I don't expect him to become a certain guard who's name shall not be said in terms of handles, but I would like him to be able to get himself out of certain situations better than he can right now when his driving fails"

- The Lakers got LeBron James. When you have LeBron, you are going all-in no matter what. AD idolizes Bron and was going to end up in LA no matter what. He was able to force New Orleans hand, and the Lakers were able to pair Bron with another top 7 player. They are also a destination city.

0,B_Sox,1601756810,"Adding Theis to this trade seems dumb to me, as I'd absolutely want to keep him around, but I truly don't understand why such a great deal of posters on here are against the theoretical Hayward for Turner swap. I like healthy Hayward a lot as a player, but I think it's a pretty difficult argument to make that we will be seeing much more improvement going forward for him as he begins to age. Given that, I think it's the perfect opportunity to balance our team a little more and swap one of our players that is 7-8 years older than our 2 main building blocks, for someone that is right on their timeline. 

While Turner is not the perfect player (Hayward certainly isn't either), he does have room for improvement and we've seen what Brad's coaching and schemes have done for many guys that have come through our organization in the last 4-5 years. He isn't undersized, is already one of the best shot blockers in the league, has improved defending in space, and is a confident and solid 3pt shooter that fits the offense seamlessly. I think Theis was absolutely amazing in his role this year and did everything we could've asked/expected, but I do think it would help to have an upgrade. Imagine what it would be like though to have a bigger version of Theis with room for improvement for 28 MPG and then be able to bring Theis himself off the bench for the other 20. There would never be any worries about the 5 spot for the foreseeable future. 

We could then obviously use some guard/wing depth for our bench, but that's where Romeo &amp; Grant, these upcoming draft picks, and whatever else Ainge can finagle will come into play. 

Bottom line, I think it clearly sets us up better for the future, but could also potentially make us better immediately too."

You can place JT in more situations than you can place Luka and see success. I'm also going with Tatum because he's proven to compete in deep playoff runs. we dont know if Luka can do that yet. I can see Luka as the better player long term but Tatum will be a more successful team player and that's what it's about at the end of the day.

He's a good regular season player, but that's because nobody's really gameplanning for anything during the regular season, they *are* during the playoffs. 

4 is also a tough look, who would we realistically trade Hayward for that would be a starting caliber defensive center? 

5 is possible, but it would probably be a singular vet, not multiple veterans. I think we can only get a single guy for the MLE unless we trade most of our rookies (and honestly only Grant Williams has any value in a trade honestly).

0,NoogynSmith,1601754227,"Warning, wall of text. TLDR below.

IMO Jaylen's ceiling is a hybrid of Klay Thompson and DWade, which makes him a perfect complementary piece next to ball-dominant players on the team. I'm not saying peak JB would look like prime Wade or Game 6 Klay but I think his game can benefit alot from the learning from those two.

On offense, as an off ball player, I think a valuable skill for JB to have is screen navigation and off-ball cut to the basket for an easy look. As the defense focus/collapse on the primary ball handler, he can pick his spot and act as a pressure-release valve near the basket/weak side corner 3 instead of parking in the corner for the entire possession. This theoretically keeps the defense honest and give the primary ball handler some more room to operate. Precise cut to the basket or an open triple in the corner around screen(s) would allow JB to score with relatively less effort and keeps his efficiency high, saving some juice and explosiveness for defense where he is often tasked with guarding the best wing on the other team. 

When Jaylen is involved in the strong side action, whether through dribble hand-off or straight up pnr as the initiator or second option, Jaylen could learn alot from Gordon Hayward or Wade or even JT. JB has showned flashes of being a ball handler after penetration, throwing hook passes to the corner or throwing lob to the roll man. The next step would be learning how to put the guarding player ""in jail"" to give him time and space for the next move, either snaking to the basket through big man sealing or pull back into space near the FT line for a middy or find a target to pass. These are the things Gordon does very well while JT has been doing it for the whole season and playoffs. Hopefully JB can learn from his teamates and become more well-rounded in CBS offense. 

On defense, hopefully as he learns alot from cutting and navigating screens, JB would make less mistakes as an off-ball defender and minimize mental lapses that results in wide open looks near the basket/3pt line. Another aspect on defense that he could work on is too minimize fouling while staying physical, taking the page out of Marcus Smart book. Being tasked with guarding the best wing on the other team ain't easy, but the worse outcome is foul trouble, that way he can't even contribute on the other end cuz he is not on the court.

Watching Jaylen since his day 1 in the league, I think he has shown tremendous growth on both sides of the ball game. I really have high hopes for him and so does the team. Based on his trajectory as a player so far, I don't doubt that he'll come back even hungrier to improve his game and take the team further.

TLDR: Offense: off-ball movement for easy opportunities, on-ball decision-making and handling. Defense: less getting caught ball watching, less fouling while staying physical."
0,TheyCallMeNick_1,1601754210,I havent watched a ton of Doncic but isn't he a bad defender? I'd take Tatum.
0,SoSoISuppose,1601753940,"Reasonable take. Not particularly close but not leagues apart.

I don‚Äôt think trading Hayward is the solution. We very clearly saw this playoffs that we lack depth on the bench, so the solution is to trade one of our top 4 and a starting caliber center for a guy who‚Äôs a lateral move and an end of the bench player?

You're also conveniently ignoring that Gordo and Theis are now **expiring contracts**, you're not getting a 1:1 talent trade anywhere, especially not one where you get a 24yr old, shooting, blocking, 6'11"" big under contract for 3 more yrs in return.

Most of these ""young cores"" you see in the NBA will be disbanded in the next few seasons give or take. 

It's reality though, what happens is most of those young players end up leaving after they aren't able to thread the needle, and then you have to rebuild again. I think I've come to terms with that, and at this point I don't think we're gonna be able to get those 2 top 10 players that we need for a championship, but at the very least I'm happy we can get some competitive games and series out of the Celtics."

It's crazy how you say this without even knowing what you're talking about.

In the regular season Doncic took exactly 2 more shots a game than Tatum.

In the playoffs Doncic took 1.7 shots more while playing without his second option.

In both scenarios Doncic is more efficient on higher volume.

0,luckymanIV1103,1601751046,"Sheesh @ ""horrible"" lol.

""Heavily downgrade"" means that you don't think redistributing Gordo's 14 FGAs a game to Kemba, JB, JT, &amp; Myles would result in similar scoring/efficiency. I don't agree with that.

I think you're neglecting Smart's ballhandling and passing ability a bit in terms of his replacing Gordo. Turner replacing Theis would be unchanged on both fronts.

I think Myles getting bullied by the remaining few physical bigs in the league is a bit overblown, but that seems to be the popular opinion so okay. 

Theis is making $5M for one more year, then he'll likely be priced higher than we're willing to pay, especially with Bob's eventual/hopeful improvement."

I think an area where we might see a big jump in is decisive drives and finishing with contact in the paint.

Giannis just won a 2nd MVP at age 25, averaged 27/14/6 in the playoffs on 56% FG 

AD is averaging 29/10/3.5 this playoffs on 58% shooting on top of being a top 3 defender

Jokic is the 3rd best big man in the NBA after Giannis and AD, averaged 24/10/6 in the playoffs, (43% from 3)

LeBron basically guarantees we get to the finals in those 2-3 years and gives us a good chance to win with JB, Smart and Kemba around him.  Tatum leaves if he doesn‚Äôt take us to the finals in 5 years (1 more on rookie, 4 on extension), which he definitely could, but not as likely as with LeBron. 

I‚Äôll give you Jokic and Kawhi‚Äôs injuries but it seems like he has a really good system for taking care of them for the playoffs, which is what matters.

Theis greatest skill in my opinion is his offense - not his scoring, but how he moves to create space for Tatum, Kemba, etc. If he had a bit more beef I don't think he'd be as good on offense.

There's a pretty good chance we'd have to dump smart as well. Hayward is obviously gone in this scenario.

We'd almost definitely be sending Kemba to a lottery team that is able to eat that much salary, cementing us as the team that fucks players over and no one trusts enough to want to play for. 

Delaying Tatum's extension is also a risky move that could completely backfire. He has done everything possible to earn his max extension and we'd be asking him to risk all of that on the chance he might get hurt before he ever gets his payday. 

Then if we're able to clear the space, we will have to convince Giannis that him and the Js plus nothing but spare parts is his best shot at a title and that Boston is a place he wants to live. 

I guess it's theoretically possible and I know better than to put anything past Ainge, but I really think it's like 1% chance or less."

0,-Zaytoven-,1601712672,"Eh, disagree with your first point. Forcing a trade doesn‚Äôt hurt your brand. Especially if you‚Äôre going from New Orleans to LA. It can only help at that point. He knew that, and he knew just the presence of him and LeBron was good enough to have a shot. Now they‚Äôre cake walking through the finals. I‚Äôm certain if the Bucks had the assets, they would‚Äôve made the move. It‚Äôs a no brainer to pair those two and to try to keep Giannis for his supermax. 

The Toronto situation was definitely rare, couldn‚Äôt agree more. That‚Äôs what makes it all the more frustrating when people blame Ainge for not trading for Kawhi. Toronto almost knew for a fact he wasn‚Äôt coming back, but they knew if they failed they could blow their team up and restart, much like they‚Äôre about to get ready to do soon (Siakam, OG, and FVV‚Äôs development changed their course a bit). With the Celtics, once Kawhi left, championship or not, it was a complete rebuild from the ground up. Toronto didn‚Äôt really trade any assets besides Poetl who is meh so far. 

I think AD knew very early (even before the LeBron stuff was even on the table) on Kyrie had no intentions of coming back, whether he heard it from Kyrie or not is up in the air; But he knew. I think KD, Kyrie and AD was definitely a possibility at one point but it fell apart once Kyrie decided he was gone. Had the Celtics traded for AD, Kyrie re-signed, Golden State almost certainly would rather receive Hayward than DLo in the sign and trade. The only downside for time would‚Äôve been creating a super team. Though Durant wasn‚Äôt healthy and we still don‚Äôt know he‚Äôll ever be the same. But, if all of those moves were made, I just couldn‚Äôt see 1, the Lakers standing pat in FA hoping AD leaves his new super team, and 2, AD leaving the super team before we ever got to see it full strength lol. 

Idk I‚Äôll always die on the hill that Kyrie, KD, and AD was the master plan. Unfortunately we‚Äôll never know because Kyrie is a headcase."
0,ShirleySerious1,1601712456,"Rondo is not much better than having Kemba, or even Smart. Imagine Kemba playing with AD and LeBron - I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd manage a fair few assists and 15 points. Anyway, I see Tatum doing more ball handling like LeBron and Simmons.

0,SmartBrown-SemiTerry,1601712067,"I've always wondered how close that ever truly was to happening. One wonders if Ainge expected him to pick GSW, given our front offices' and ownership groups' relative closeness. Wouldn't be surprised if the main discussion was for after his GSW stint. But who knows."
0,SmartBrown-SemiTerry,1601711995,"I think that was mostly window dressing (the reports about other teams). That was to help save face and ultimately, preserve his persona and brand. Fact of the matter is, with a major superstar trade like that, it's more than just agents and front offices involved. This is about brand value, this is about merchandising, this is about media ratings, this is about winning the championship (the NBA). Quite frankly, I think once they had made it clear enough where he was oriented towards being, no one was going to really make the move. No one was in a position like Toronto was in 2019. That was a very, VERY rare situation.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Toronto had been making consistent playoff runs and getting stonewalled and had seemingly eked out most of what it was going to get from its talent. And it was still a superstar and some solid role players away from making the full run it needed. In addition to needing some kind of actual championship DNA, finals experience.  
  
With Lebron leaving the conference, it was the perfect time to strike. Especially with Kawhi's value taking a hit (hadn't played in a year mind you).  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
I think Ainge had designs for a Kyrie / KD / AD pairing and that might have been a possibility, but I also think Ainge knew for awhile that Kyrie wasn't likely to stick around. I say this because we really got a steal on him when we traded for him. The package we put together at the time didn't make enough sense. And I would assume Lebron divulged everything there was to know about Kyrie when had that dinner with AD during the 2018 regular season. Pair all that with the conspicuous Lakers' trades with the Cavs and others going through that season and you can just tell that things were planned out behind the scenes well in advance. Jeanie Buss and Wyc Grousbeck are actually friends, and they've hung out with Adam Silver plenty of times too. I think Ainge had a package in place to be flexible, and at the very least, to drive up the price on any potential trade, but I don't think he ultimately had any intention of pulling the trigger. Not with all the glaring signs leading up to that point, within a year of the actual trade.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Ainge designed this rebuild on making us as flexible as possible, to capitalize on opportunities as they came up. For the most part, it has worked out fairly well, aside from things that weren't in our control. Moving forward, I imagine there are other targets he has in mind, but now things shift, because our young talent is poised to become the draw, which is a position we haven't yet occupied."
0,WreckUless,1601711723,I‚Äôm salty about it too but we don‚Äôt deserve to be there. Watching the lakers literally pick apart this zone defense is exactly what I expected out of the Celtics but we never performed for more than a few possessions at a time. We struggled vs Toronto when they played zone and got killed by Miami. I hope we grow and learn from the experience it‚Äôs going to be even tougher next time
0,SmartBrown-SemiTerry,1601711385,"Rondo is my favorite player from that era, and even then, I say probably not. For starter's, I think he's in a good place finally after all those journeyman years. AD and Bron love him and respect him. Vogel and the front office seem to understand how to treat him. The Lakers fan base isn't going to care if he only shows up in the playoffs, as long as he shows up in the playoffs.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
With Boston it's different and I think part of the reason we shipped him off in the first place. There were temptations originally to try and build a team around him. But the truth is, him and Brad would never have worked. Rondo has always had too much ego to really defer too much to coaching. With Vogel it works out because he has enough pedigree and more importantly, he's got Lebron and Anthony Davis in his corner. And that's ultimately what Rondo is about. He worked out okay with Doc, but it was a lot more of Garnett, Pierce, and the others doing the leading and chemistry work that kept things in check. He is not a coach's player, he's a player's player. And he'll be far better off playing with Lebron, someone he respects that can actually hold him accountable, than he would in Boston, where we have a relative youth movement taking place and are trying to build around the character of those guys. We need and want people playing 100% for most of the season and we have a certain type of style and scheme we're trying to run. We can't get better at it if there's dissension in the ranks."

The team lost a ton of guys last offseason with Kyrie, Rozier, Horford, Baynes, and Morris departing.

Although Ainge made moves to keep the team competitive, I think he wanted to see what he had before adding that sort of vet we both would like to see. 

With how the salary cap works, Ainge knows that finding some young talent in the draft could prove vital to keeping the title window open a couple years from now. I suspect they kept us out off the luxury tax this season knowing it would be more all in from 2020-21 on.

I just couldn‚Äôt see a scenario where AD got traded to Boston (assuming Kyrie stayed), and LA signs no deals wasting another year of LeBrons prime and contract while they could‚Äôve signed someone like Kawhi, Kemba, KD, Klay, Jimmy Butler, etc. IIRC the Lakers could‚Äôve easily created two max slots.

I don't really think the Heat are *that* great or anything, but I really don't see who else is going to make the Finals. 

The Bucks are never making the Finals with Budenholzer as coach, ditto for the Sixers and Doc, the Nets are going to be a disaster and project to be an atrocious defensive team. I feel like it's strictly between the Heat, Celtics, and Raptors, and of those 3 teams, I trust the Heat the most."

I wonder if he's changed approach now that he has Brad as coach, and he tries to use the draft and go the player development model. And he doesn't seem to target the right kind of vets, we get veterans with minimal playoff success like Horford, Hayward, and Kemba.

I think GS would really struggle to generate easy baskets vs. the Lakers and would become strictly a jump shooting team. 

I think the reason that Dallas could be such a tough matchup for the Lakers next season is outside of LeBron, the Lakers don't have a single player on their roster who could feasibly defend Luka, and Porzingis is about as good as you're going to get in terms of defending AD 1v1, which you need to do, because if you double AD, he'll pass to LeBron, who will then pick you apart before you can recover."

As fans we are impatient, but Baynes knows the system and if he was willing to return for the MLE, I'd love to have him. He's such a big dude and such a good presence. I remember him and Theis having an excellent relationship. He liked it here a lot. And he has championship experience with the Spurs. I'd really love to have him back. 

Draft night's going to be a big day for the C's. We could draft a center like Tillman, but the quality, quality big men in this draft are limited to Onyeka and potentially Wiseman if he pans out. But we'll see. I'm hoping our roster looks better next season."

0,TatumBrownSmart,1601699753,"I personally don't think that much of the Warriors next year, maybe (hopefully) I'll be completely wrong, I *love* watching them play, but they are just not the same beast that they used to be. For one thing they're a lot older than they were in the pre-KD 2014-16 years, and in losing Iguodala, they lost a key role player that amplified their play style. At this point, they really don't have that many good NBA players anymore, they have their Core 3, and Andrew Wiggins, who can hopefully fill the Harrison Barnes role, but as we saw with HB in the 2016 Finals, there's limits to how far you can go with a player like that playing high minutes. 

I feel pretty confident that there's only one challenger in the West, and maybe the entire league, to the Lakers next year, and that's Dallas. Luka and Porzingis are a JV LeBron and AD. They also have a championship proven head coach in Carlisle. I would be pretty stunned if that was not the WCF next year."

0,Eisenhorn76,1601698986,"Again, we don‚Äôt know that. You‚Äôre basing it on other teams‚Äô performance. So what? We only have how well the Celtics played against the Lakers and the Celtics won that in total. 

The thing about these Lakers is that they struggle the most against teams with wings like the Celtics‚Äô, which is why the Clippers were perceived as their most serious challenger ‚Äî it‚Äôs just that the latter reverted to their history of choking and we didn‚Äôt get to see it.

Truth: this Lakers team even with AD would get owned hard by the healthy KD-led Warriors team of two seasons ago, yet the core of this Celtics team could match-up against even that team fairly well. That‚Äôs been true for much of the entire Brad era; he basically coached the Celtics to a draw against them during their peak. Am I supposed to agree that he couldn‚Äôt do that against the Lakers just because Miami was hot for 3 weeks?

All in all, there is no way I would bet against this Celtics team facing the Lakers. Matchups are very tricky in the NBA. The reason people are so raw over losing to Miami in the first place is that they many felt that the Celtics had a great chance against them. People weren‚Äôt angry about losing to Miami. They were angry at letting a championship slip away. 

Jaylen Brown showed he could guard AD and Lebron quite effectively in spots. Tatum was putting up numbers - albeit inefficiently on the scoring side of it - that put him in the same ballpark as Giannis and Lebron. 

Would the Celtics have been favored? Probably not - the media is biased in favor or Lebron and Kemba is not playoff-tested ‚Äî but I would give this team a 40-45% chance against the Lakers. It‚Äôs just a shame Kemba and Gordon were not themselves or we might be watching a 1-1 series now. 

I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre even on this sub if you‚Äôre just going to wave a flag and act like it *fait accompli* that LA would beat the Celtics. HELL NO. 

Miami catching fire was a gift to the Lakers. With all those injuries, the 2020 Finals is a mockery: they should just cut it short and hand LA the chip."

He became Marcus Dumb instead of Marcus Smart, resorted to making hero plays instead of making the right plays, even his defense slipped too, one of the critical plays in Game 4 he was backcut by Herro. 

Which was incredibly annoying because he was *fantastic* in the Raptors series. What he was in the Raptors series is what we want from Smart and I hope Danny and Brad reinforce that to him."
0,HitmanWalks,1601698882,Agreed - his goal was always the Lakers. Would‚Äôve been a rental and we most likely still wouldn‚Äôt have won the chip with him (after giving up JB or JT plus more).

0,TatumBrownSmart,1601698627,"I mean, AD was always this good of a basketball player, this is just the first time in his career that he's playing with a legitimate point guard, which is what he always needed, and LeBron is so insanely overqualified for that role. 

This is like when KD went from playing with OKC's spacing to playing with Golden State's spacing. It's a lot easier for the world to see your qualities as a basketball player when you are playing with the optimal personnel. 

Ultimately, the dude didn't want to play here and would have been a rental, so no. The day he signed with Klutch, it was over."

0,PettyEmbezzlement,1601698356,"My girlfriend met Rajon Rondo back in 2013 or so, about a year before I met her. She used to be a high school teacher at Boston Public somewhere in Dorchester/Roxbury if I can remember correctly. 

She took her 9th grade class of 30 or so kids to some museum in Boston. Afterwards, they went over to the Prudential Mall. She took several girls over to a Lord and Taylor department store (or something along those lines), and on the first floor near perfume was Rondo standing around talking with some other guy around the same height. My gf is from Connecticut and totally a Knicks fan (eww, I know), but she‚Äôs definitely a pretty big NBA fan in general (definitely nice to have a bonafide NBA-aware gf). Given the success of the Celtics during the preceding 5 years, she definitely knew who Rajon Rondo was. 

Well, so did her girl students. They basically squealed in excitement and were all like ‚Äúno, way. It‚Äôs Rajon Rondo!!‚Äù My girlfriend decided to walk towards Rondo (and his friend) and tell him that her students really wanted to meet him. Before they even got close, he turned towards them and said hi. She told me Rajon was exactly like you think he would be. Decent dude, a bit aloof, but mainly just straightforward...a man of little words. Yes, she noticed his hands - definitely larger than average, but not alien. She also noted that he looked younger than he appeared on TV, but also taller than she‚Äôd imagined (by about an inch or two). Finally, he was pretty well dressed - not in a suit or anything though . He was in his stylish phase in Boston at the time, interning with GQ and all that jazz. 

Just as my gf and her students were leaving (she didn‚Äôt want to bother him for too long) Rajon asked the students whether they were big Celtics fans. The girls squealed and said ‚Äúomg of course, duh‚Äù. My gf turned around and was all like ‚Äúnope. Knicks and Melo all the way. I‚Äôm a fan of actual good shooters - not flashy point guards.‚Äù Lol. Rondo just kind of chuckled at that. He was pretty good natured about it. 

The sad irony was that the Celtics would later that year proceed to lose to the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs. Thank god I wasn‚Äôt together with the gf back then. I probably would‚Äôve had to break up with her over the Knicks beating the Celtics (though didn‚Äôt we all know the Heat were going to annihilate them? The Knicks didn‚Äôt even get THAT far though. PG and the Pacers took them down in round 2 - felt wonderful to watch). 

P.S 
Brief aside, my gf saw Ben Affleck in public 3 weeks later at the Tatte Bakery on Charles St. in Beacon Hill . She was behind him in line and they both waited for pastries or something. They somehow made some simple small talk conversation about the wait. She asked him something about his latest project or whatever, and then she unintentionally implied that she far preferred him as a director than as an actor (or vice versa, I forget). He sort of paused and ended the conversation awkwardly. 

Now that I think of it, she definitely has a foot-in-mouth problem with celebrities in public."

You can't force a gm to build their team a certain way. They tried the supermax but that hasn't worked at all.

0,solarscopez,1601693919,"We would've been in the finals, I think we had a higher FG, 3P, and FT% than the Heat. Looking at the stats I think we outrebounded them as well.

What killed us in the series was our turnovers. Was size going to be a problem down the line against the Lakers if we played them? Probably, but that wasn't the main reason we couldn't get past the Heat. And to make it worse most of our turnovers were in the 4th quarter. 

And it's not like we were just turning the ball over against the Heat, we did it against the Raptors as well we just got lucky that they didn't capitalize off them in the end. Managing turnovers and controlling the ball is gonna have to be a huge priority in the next postseason. I think part of it might be because we're a young and inexperience team, but whether or not it is, it's something we need to do a lot less of going forward.

0,Blackadar1,1601691064,"The guy has been a net negative in defense virtually his entire career. DBPM, DRTG all are quite below average and he never passes the eye test on defense. Because he somehow led in drtg on a bad team for half a season means absolutely jack shit. There aren't any career statistics that show Lin being even average in defense.  

Per 36 is meaningless when a guy plays fewer than 20 minutes per game, especially on a shit teams like Atlanta or Brooklyn. Racking up meaningless points on non-playoff teams and then trying to equate that on a per 36 is fool's gold (*and you're wrong, he's not 22 points/per 36 over the last 3 years - more like 18 per 36  - and so made up stats don't help prove your point*). Per 36 Tacko Fall scored 25 ppg last season on a good team. Yeah, lots of good that stat is.

So what was (not is, more on that later) Lin **realistically**? Lin is a career sub-par 3pt shooter at 34% career from 3 point land and 29% in his last season in the league. Sure, if you're going to give him the ball with a usage of 25% he'll score enough but the net impact is more than negative. He's racked up moderate offensive statistics in an off-the-bench role on bad teams for most of his career. And again, there's zero track record of any playoff impact. He doesn't fill any need whatsoever. 

What's worse, this is all Lin from TWO YEARS AGO. He's older now and played in a bad Chinese league. He couldn't even get a decent offer from the NBA. He's not coming back better than ever after playing lesser competition. There will be plenty of vet FAs looking to snag a roster spot on a young contending team like the Celtics. If Ainge thinks the Cs need a PG there's no reason to scrape the bottom of the barrel for a sub-par retread (read that carefully) like Lin.  

Finally, the Celtics don't need a PG mentor. That's Kemba's job and he's better at it too."

0,-Zaytoven-,1601683952,It is the most IIRC
0,SmartBrown-SemiTerry,1601683913,"I had a really strong realization a couple days ago about this possibility. The issue is, once Tatum's extension goes into effect, we don't have that space anymore. So unless they held off on that until next offseason (which I do not expect to happen), then I don't see how we could do this, without trading some of our guys.  
  
But yes, if Hayward opts in and renegotiates, and Tatum were to hold off, we could theoretically clear enough space to sign Giannis. I do think that of all his potential destinations, Boston would be easily the best one, given how the timelines align. I think we have the spread of character, tenacity, and leadership that would allow him to flourish without the unnecessary pressure, but the alpha narrative would get sacrificed in the process. That could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it.  
  
Goes without saying that the resultant line ups would be absolutely disgusting. But who knows.  
   
&amp;nbsp;  

I do believe that the front office has been watching him and I wouldn't be surprised if they've been watching more closely after what went down with AD. The issue is, Giannis isn't as good as AD in my opinion. But if there's anyone worth pursuing, Giannis is that guy that makes sense. I know Ainge scouted him back in 2013, but they went with Olynyk, not knowing that the Nets were about to call with a crazy offer. Otherwise it's very possible that we would have picked Giannis. Ainge compared him to Pippen back then. No idea where things stand now."

What I saw this playoffs was tangible improvement in playmaking ability overall, even over his monstrous February/March. 3.3:2.5 = 1.32 A/TO ratio in Feb/March, 5.0:2.8 = 1.79 in the playoffs. And that was against much better defenses who should be forcing turnovers at a higher rate.

Per 36 he averaged 3.20 in Feb/March, 4.44 in the playoffs. So that accounts for the increased minutes workload right there. And lastly, his usage rate in the regular season vs. playoffs was nearly identical this season.

Again, I like 5.0 as a floor next season."
0,King_Of_Pants,1601679401,"Then again, he wasn't getting paid knowing what we know. 

It's not like Ainge would have just maxed Isaiah after seeing how rough he was coming back from injury. He'd either get a small prove-it style contract from us in 2018 or walk in FA.

So the question really is: Would you rather have had the two years with Kyrie or held onto Jae Crowder + The 2018 #8 pick + maintained some goodwill with players?

In hindsight, I do still think trading for Kyrie was the right play, but it is an interesting question. 

* Having an extra body (Jae) in the 2018 playoffs could have led to Boston making a finals appearance. 

* Having the #8 pick would have been nice in terms of rounding out our young core. The Ringer had Shai Gilgeous-Alexander #8 on their boards that year and we would have been looking for a guard so it would have been a 50-50 between him and Collin Sexton (who's also not terrible).

* Plus there's the question of whether this team benefitted long term from Kyrie's tenure. It's clear they learnt a lot from playing with him, it's also clear he left some baggage behind. Does the good outweigh the bad or vice versa?"

0,joelvmoran,1601679135,I agree with this 100%. I forgot about the Sexton pick AND Crowder. Thomas would have resigned to a team friendly deal because once he hit the market he would‚Äôve have noticed no team wanted to sign him for a boat load of money
0,androidthirteen,1601679040,"I don‚Äôt understand all the anti-Isaiah sentiment here... I agree with you OP based on a couple things:

-We gave up Isaiah (plus Crowder, Zizic, and the Sexton pick) for Kyrie (who in hindsight was not much of an upgrade on/off the court)
-Kemba gets exposed on defense pretty often as well (although it might be up to Brad to hide him more effectively)
-Kemba inarguably underperformed in the playoffs whereas Isaiah shined and stepped up (but there is much more expectation/pressure on this team now and Isaiah was the offense and 1st option)

Honestly if I (and I emphasize that this is my opinion but I can already see the downvotes coming) could re-do the Isaiah experience, I‚Äôd have tried to sign him to a team-friendly long-term deal because Kemba is, whether you all like it or not, overpaid for what he is/will be.

The little ones around me laugh at the idea of a Lakers-Celtics rivalry for example, but as you clearly understand and as I was trying to explain to said redditor earlier who just didn't agree, there are many different aspects that create and sustain a rivalry.

0,ShampooMonK,1601667472,"Uhhh, what?

Let me get this straight...

Kemba, Brown, Smart, Romeo, Hayward, and basically majority of our picks for Giannis, Bledsoe, and Matthews?

I ***mean***, it's **Giannis**.

If there's anyone in the league that could masterfully build a contender with Tatum &amp; Giannis, it's Ainge. I have to also think this trade is not possible legally.

I've mentioned many times here, I'd give up anyone not named Tatum for him.

First off, the outgoing salaries wouldn't match the cap salary in the NBA. Over $70 million getting sent out, and since the Bucks are a tax-paying team, they can only accept around $58.1 million.

Secondly, that's a lot of players to give up for Giannis. I mean, like I've mentioned, it is **Giannis**. But if Tatum or Giannis gets injured, then we're back to the drawing board once again.

Finally, why would the Bucks want Hayward and Kemba? If the Bucks are trading Giannis, they're looking to either re-tool, or re-build. If re-building, your assets and what is deemed useful to your organization may not be as highly prioritized by some. I just don't see a reason why the Bucks would want Hayward + Kemba unless they either want to try to make the playoffs or build up their trade value and ship them out for more assets."

0,Realistic_Flatworm51,1601666905,"For vucevic yes we send out Hayward, Romeo Langford and the bucks frp this year #30 for Vucevic and Terrence Ross. He is a great rebounder, a guy who can pass like horford, has a good shot, great scorer in the post. Myles Turner is a guy who can shoot and catch lobs and protect the rim and is a versatile on a cheaper contract than vucevic also signed for 3 more years. Cons to both are vucevic is 29 compared to Turner being like 25, vucevic isn‚Äôt the defender that Turner is, vucevic will need the ball in the post but I think he works just like horford but a better scorer but worse on defensive switches. Turner is a bad rebounder that‚Äôs his only issue.

Weird times where teams aren't going to be able to have individual workouts with players so they won't fall in love with guys who have great workouts.

I could be wrong, and that's not meant as a dig, but I still make that bet. You don't have to acknowledge regional rivalries as a thing. Doesn't stop them from existing. The Dolphins and Bills are in our division. I didn't list them as rivals.

The Celtics sucked for the entirety of the 90s. Did that stop them from being rivals with the Lakers? Of course not. Why? Because that is an example of a historical rivalry. It will exist no matter what, and yes, it can get one sided at times. The Red Sox-Yankees rivalry was one sided for almost 90 years, yet that is maybe the most famous rivalry in sports because it is both historical and regional. As I mentioned at the end of my post, another type of rivalry that exists is rivalries between the fanbases more than between the actual teams. The way you feel about the Sixers is the way I feel about the Leafs. The B's have the Leafs number, especially in the playoffs. On the Boston side, we don't feel the rivalry as much, but utter the B word to a Leafs fan and see how they take it. So I don't feel the competitive aspects of that rivalry as of is the one thing you focus on, but I acknowledge there is a rivalry between the teams. Playing the Leafs has a different feel than playing say, the Panthers.

There are various factors that constitute what makes up a rivalry, not just competition. If you have tunnel vision for just that, then in your words.. have fun."

Jeremy Lin might give you 10mpg during the regular season but he won't see the court in the playoffs unless he pays for a ticket. He's a terrible liability on defense and a below-average 3pt shooter. What the hell is he going to do for the team?

0,MurderingRayLewis,1601655483,"Who *did* have a chance to beat the Lakers, then? 

A fully healthy Heat would likely make it 6 games, max, but probably less. The Bucks proved that outside of Giannis, they don't really have anything special, so if he's not 100%, they can't do much. The 76ers blow. Toronto doesn't have a superstar either... 

The Celtics, if healthy, had the best matchups from the East to contend with LA this year.They had too much offensive potential for the Lakers to stop entirely (if they played like they're capable of), and enough defensive versatility to try to limit LA. Not saying they would win in a best of 7, but they'd surely do a hell of a lot better than the Heat are doing/going to do.

I think he's strong enough already and doesn't need to worry about bulking up so much as being smarter with how he uses his body. If you can keep your entire body between the defender and the ball it takes a lot less strength to get through them and get off a good shot. It's why a player like IT was better at finishing at the rim than Tatum who is a foot taller. I want Tatum watching Paul Pierce drives on loop all summer long. It's great he can get over guys and yam it on their heads, he you needs to be able to put them on his hip and score around them if he wants to improve his efficiency. 

The other thing that kind of goes hand in hand is I want to see him bail out the defense less by taking long jumpers. He's better than most at those contested three and it's an awesome skill to be able to pull out in a pinch, but he resorts to that shot way too often, basically the second the defense puts any obstacle to him driving.

* Aleksej Pokusevski - Has the talent but he needs to put on weight to be more than a one-in-a-million chance of even warming the bench long term. You do have to question why he hasn't put that weight on already. The NBA draft is the most important job interview of his life, he should have at least dressed the part.

* Desmond Bane - Small stature and smaller wingspan. Guys with negative wingspans (i.e. shorter than their height) often struggle in the NBA. Has to be someone really special to overcome that.

* Saddiq Bey - Will likely go top 20. I think he's a wonderful all-around piece, but he's a role player. We should be aiming higher than that with our top pick.

The problem I see with this is Steve Nash is on another level compared to kyrie in terms of the way he sees the game from the PG position. I am not so worried about the KD Nash dynamic assuming KD is GSW KD his game is efficient and not really ball dominant its quick easy buckets shooting over people. But with Kyrie and to some degree KD it ultimately comes down to do they have enough respect for Nash when he sees the best game plan to beat a team will they actually listen to him and execute or are they going to try to push back and play the game the way they want to.

Granted, with the current team, we need him to pick up behind them. But he has done that up until his recent issues.

Look at his past. He has less playoff experience than both of the Jays. He only made the playoffs 3 times carrying Charlotte on his back in 8 years, and they always got bounced in the 1st round. This is the 1st time he made it to the 2nd round, let alone the ECF.

No shit he didn't keep up. He may be older but that doesn't mean he has experienced everything, nor does that mean he can't learn from it. Let alone in the bubble, which is a huge difference enough as it is.

There is a lot of talk about about a Horford for Hield swap w/ PHI including Thybulle or Shake. This would be pretty devastating from a Cs fan perspective since the Sixers desperately need shooting and this essentially gives them a low-end 3rd/4th star type player who fits perfectly.

0,hipcheck23,1601642132,"How is Rose defensively? Just glancing at stats, he's better in OWS than Brad W, but equally worse in DWS.

As for the prospects: I'm always a bit of a homer with them, but I feel like all of them still have a chance to be starter-level players. Romeo is the most talented, clearly a world-class talent all-around, but he's only shown that offensive ability in little flashes. Of course the injuries have been frequent...

Tre seems to be the one coaches like the most, but of course he's more likely to accidentally be dunked himself than to dunk one himself. After having IT4, it's hard to picture running our current system with Tre getting regular minutes... but if he got halfway to IT4 production then it might be worth it.

Tacko of course could be anything he wants if he's able to play at full speed. Who knows if that will ever happen. Right now he's just a steal target for any good player.

Carsen is much better at D than I thought he would be... a lot better than his height. But he still makes fundamental mistakes, and his shot hasn't been there since the preseason. If he hits his potential he'd be amazing to have around, like a FVV. 

Grant is clearly ready to plug in, and his offense isn't bad, he just isn't ready to be counted on for it. I think he'll be around for a long time, as he's already plugged some of the holes that Horford left."

0,SquimJim,1601640918,"Makes sense. I don't really have a lot of hope for what Carsen can bring. He might find a consistent shot, he might not, either way he's not good enough on offense to be that big of a liability on defense. 

Langford is the opposite. He plays good D, so he'll get minutes, but I'm not sure his shot will be close to what we want it to be. He could be a decent backup though. 

My biggest concern is health and depth. I'd like to be deep enough to handle losing 2-3 guys, (especially since what happened this year with injuries). We aren't there right now and I'd rather have a guarantee of production if that were to happen in the playoffs.

0,empiricsnothysterics,1601640660,"I mean 19 minutes is basically the most we'd want from Wanamaker. Neither he nor any rookie is likely to be taking minutes from Kemba or Smart. I would say there's a difference between rookies who are given burn (i.e. 20+ minutes) and rookies who can come in and be trusted role players for a championship team.

0,hipcheck23,1601640274,"I do like Wanamaker - he's cheap, experienced and solid. If you look at our 2 best starting 5s, it does leave either Smart or Hayward for the 2nd unit (1: KW/JT/JB/GH/DT - 2: KW/MS/JT/JB/DT) so Wanamaker is never needed as the primary handler on the first 2 units, unless they trot out KW/MS/JB/JT/GH, which leaves us without a Big.

Having Rose and Hayward to anchor a 2nd unit wouldn't be a bad thing, of course, it just seems like they want to focus on Wings and Bigs. I think we're better off with shooters, and Romeo/Carson could be ready next season.

TBH I haven't gotten my head even started on trades for next season because the playoffs are still going... I just feel like I'll be surprised if we make moves towards guards."

I wouldn't mind upgrading any of our players (can't upgrade the Jays for their current values), but I don't think we'll have a sure way to do so.  I think maxing out TL is the key to the future... if not, then we do need to find a Kanter replacement with better D.

0,hipcheck23,1601638818,"I'm in the ""don't overreact"" camp. Seems like I'm in the minority.

This team looked like a fringe contender at the beginning of the season, and yet that taste of success always makes us go into full chip-or-bust mode around here. 

Let's be realistic:

- Theis isn't AD. That's fine - he was excellent in the bubble and a great complement for our other 5-6 best players. He also improved a hell of a lot from last season (a lot just getting over injury, but also a good bit just improving).
- JT took a big step into the season and then again into the bubble. He sometimes fell short in the playoffs, but does anyone really expect him not to take another step into next season?
- JB has the most talk about improving and continuing to improve, and rightfully so. I expect him to improve as well.
- Both the Jays are very mature 'kids' but they definitely showed their youth at times in the bubble, and that's totally fine. I just mention it because they should both continue to mature.
- Kemba ""wasn't Kemba"" as Ainge just said. He should have been our best player but something was off. Let's be optimistic and expect that to correct itself soon.
- Smart is Smart.
- We had a really short bench for the playoffs, so we really don't need to 'go out and get player 8 or 9' to get over the hump; we need to bring into the rotation more than just TL. We need real minutes from 1-2 of the other prospects.
- Our crop of kids is still amazing, we just didn't see most of them in the playoffs. By next playoffs, the bottom half of the roster WILL be much better, and I'd expect Romeo and TL to feature in the same way Wanamaker has - and hopefully Grant takes another step up and Carson/Tacko/Tre can get thrown into the mix as well.
- TL is looking better and better. He's really the player we need, if only he can keep improving...

That's just where we are with what we have. The draft isn't going to help us, and I can't see how we're going to trade for AD-Lite to replace Theis. This team was almost ready for primetime, we just couldn't play a full 48 against MIA - let's not panic, eh?"
0,JeremyMcDev,1601638769,"If the Pacers are really interested in trading Victor and Myles the more I think about it the more I like it. If we could work a deal out around Hayward, (Theis or Kanter), and some picks I would be all about it. Maybe some end of the bench filler depending on what else they want.

0,RLS012,1601638733,"The problem there is he doesn't play like a wing on offense, he plays like a big.

I‚Äôm serious when I say this... when I see a kyrie quote without an accompanying video, I‚Äôm always suspicious it‚Äôs actually something written by a machine learning artificial intelligence. 

For fun I went to https://talktotransformer.com/ and gave it the starting prompt **‚Äùbasketball is about more than winning games...‚Äù**

Here‚Äôs what the website spat out.  Tell me this doesn‚Äôt sound like something Kyrie would say:

&gt; Basketball is about more than winning games. It's also about achieving an ultimate and lasting legacy. It's all about brothers, cousins, teachers and coaches who helped mold these seven young men into the men they are today, men who aspire to be the best in the world. No two young men with similar backgrounds, goals and outlooks have ever come together on the basketball court. When you win games and get near the Finals, you win an organization, you win a loyalty, you win a relationship with fans and you're seeing more players who are going to become all-stars of this game. So I think winning plays a major role.

Here‚Äôs another one:

&gt; **I don‚Äôt worry about what the basketball fans think.** I understand when I play the way I do. I know I need to put more out there to make a game, and I feel great. I don't think I feel any less than I do at any point in my career, so if you don't know that, I think I just gave the basketball fans an indication. It's nothing more than that. I'm not looking for my name to be out there. I know I can play, and I'm looking forward to the next.  What matters is how it is for those outside the sport and how they feel. If you‚Äôre going to work for this organization, you‚Äôre going to feel the pain of those who go there. We care about that. Those are the things that you‚Äôre going to hear a lot from us. That is why I believe in this organization and that is why I believe in myself as an athlete.

To prove my point further, I took some of that machine-generated text, had Watson's text-to-speech read it for me, used then used a rough deepfake lipsync tech to generate **this video: https://youtu.be/E6MZrOd7zbg** 

Almost no part of this is human Kyrie.  Granted, this is extremely rough and done in minutes, but imagine someone with more skill?   **Are we even sure Kyrie Irving is a real person?**

---

FWIW, one of these quotes is allegedly real and the other is something I machine generated:

**Quote 1:**  ""*At the end of the day it's an entertainment league.*  It's a circus, the fans are rabid and it's unpredictable.  For most of the people who get into it and follow it closely, it's a fun show to be a part of.  What's the point of winning if you can't have fun with it? If we go all out, and if we do something here and there, it will be fun. There are ups and downs, there are bad days, and there are good days. We just need to stay consistent. I just think that's the only way to go.""

**Quote 2:**  ""*At the end of the day, it's an entertainment league.*  We're very drama filled.  Everything regurgitates on all these media platforms which is part of our society.  I can't do anything about it except be a pillar in our locker room, be very communicative, and when I'm out there with the guys just impact winning.

...

Good luck figuring out which is which.

 But that wasn't the real plan, we were always going to put Tatum at the top eventually.

Tatum was drafted here, and as of this past season, he's basically already been handed the team. He has the opportunity to not only be the franchise player but the biggest player in Boston sports. Let alone that, we know full well that he gets along with everyone on the team. There's no locker room conflict to the degree that we had during Kyrie's stint. We had a big argument but they showed in the next game that they resolved their issues. Friends and family can argue but what shows that they care for each other is when it doesn't break them apart.

You know how many championships have been won in the last 40 years without a one time MVP on the roster? 4. That‚Äôs it. Warriors had Durant and/or Steph. Cavs had Lebron. Spurs had Duncan. Mavs had Dirk. Celtics had KG. Heat had Shaq. Lakers had Kobe and Shaq. Bulls had MJ. Rockets had Hakeem. Celtics had Larry. Lakers had Kareem and Magic. And 1 of the four was last year‚Äôs Raptors, but Kawhi is certainly an MVP caliber player and played like one throughout those playoffs. 

I think Tatum has the potential to get to that MVP caliber, or perhaps if we have a balanced enough roster around him, he may be able to win a championship before reaching that individual level. 

Name me the last championship team where the 4th option was out hurt for the playoffs. Years that Thunder made deep runs was when they had health. Years they missed playoffs or were out early one or the other of Durant were dealing with injuries.

I didn‚Äôt say I expected a fully healthy roster every run. But I do think that the runs great teams generally win championships on rely on a bit of injury luck. They certainly played a part in many of the disappointments after 2008. KG‚Äôs knee in 2009. Which still lingered into 2010, as he was better in 2011 than 2010. Perk‚Äôs knee in 2010. Shaq and Jermaine‚Äôs injuries and Rondo‚Äôs elbow in 2011. Jeff Green‚Äôs heart in 2012, along with whatever it was that was hampering Ray, and then his replacement Avery Bradley‚Äôs shoulders were both messed up in the playoffs. 

The team that comes out on top at the end often is one of the contenders to start the year, who get through the playoffs with minimal injuries. It‚Äôs how it works."

Moreover, I don't believe that OG, Huerter, or PJ Washington as rookies would be significant parts of the rotation of an NBA championship winning team at this point in time, at least without some major lucky breaks. 

My point is relatively simple. Even by targeting older players, getting a consistent role player for the playoffs- the type the Celtics might actually need - is unlikely. This year's examples of Matisse Thybulle and Grant Williams are illustrative. Two players who I really do think will be good role players in this league - but even role players develop. When the moments mattered most in the playoffs, neither of their coaches decided they could be really counted on. 

Are there exceptions to this? Of course. But they're almost seem to be the future stars - Tatum and SGA. Two players who could be role players in the playoffs as rookies because they just turned out to be brilliant players overall. Could the Celtics draft someone who could take over 3rd string point guard minutes or represent the 3rd/4th option in the big man rotation? Of course. But that player will need to develop and adapt to the NBA, just like any other. The players that adapt the best immediately are simply the best players and that's who the Celtics should draft."

Also, this is a league where it isn't uncommon for coaches to get extended and then fired very close together. It just happened to Nate McMillan recently.

0,King_Of_Pants,1601604016,"We've seen a better version of your team face off against a worse version of our team. 

It ended in 5 games.

These hypotheticals don't work when we've already seen the matchups play out and you're overly relying on the 3-1 regular season without taking into account the context of those games. 

You had a 3-1 regular-season lead on Boston in the same way Boston won the regular season series against Miami.  You're relying on matchups where one team was rested and the other was fatigued by B2Bs. 

You caught us during the worst stretch of our season, by far. Just to put your 2nd and 3rd wins into perspective:

* Those wins came during our worst stretch of the season where Boston played with the same record as a 7-8 seed team
* We had our only two 3-game loss streaks during this stretch
* We had 10 B2B games during this stretch with very little rest in between those B2Bs
* We lost every B2B game we played against a playoff opponent (Indiana, Philly x2, Toronto, San Antonio, Milwaukee) 
* Both Boston's games against Philly were during B2Bs that also featured another playoff team (Indiana, San Antonio)


Your team isn't special for beating ours during that stretch. Everyone beat us during that stretch.

There was a thread a day or two ago here about naming a captain, and I‚Äôll fall on the sword of the stance of ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need someone to have a patch on their jersey‚Äù. Leadership comes from the gm. Then down to the coach. Then down to the players. Whichever players choose to display leadership? Good on them. They don‚Äôt need stitching on their jersey to be a leader. 

At the end of the day, you answer to the coach. He answers to the GM. He answers to the owners. 

Don‚Äôt fuck with the hierarchy. Understand your role. Do it to the best of your abilities and you‚Äôll have a prosperous career. Simple.

‚Äîside note‚Äî for a different conversation; AAU is ruining the youth. The most athletic, or most gifted kids at age 15-16 are the kids getting high D1 offers. It turns into a hierarchy like I just mentioned, at a very young age. It‚Äôs fucked. I‚Äôve been employed free lance to scout and video various tournaments in the mid west, it‚Äôs scary. The parental involvement, verbal abuse, it‚Äôs wild. It‚Äôs not about teaching and learning.

0,King_Of_Pants,1601600918,"&gt;Build more muscle mass. 

This is the big one now. 

Adding some more strength will make the game a lot easier for him and it will help with those late-game meltdown's we've seen this season. 

Towards the end of games, he looks tired and he gets spooked by big-bodied wing defenders. 

More muscle will help him with the fatigue and confidence down the stretch. If he feels like he can power through guys then he'll be less likely to settle for the step back 30fter.


It will also open up other scoring opportunities. With his frame, he should be able to break a zone by establishing a post position. Posting up isn't efficient enough to be a go-to but it is a great in-case-of-emergency option to have. 

In this regard, lower body strength will be absolutely key. Guys are taking him out of his comfort zone by defending him at the hip. Having a more powerful lower body will help with that."

0,asiancock820611,1601600695,"Well I guess we can just ignore the salary cap and salary matching real quick...

I guess they could've cut Poirier and sign Noah or Crawford for ""veteran leadership"" I do not think they would've made a difference ultimately. Its not like Noah or Crawford would've been able to stop the Celtics from jacking up 8 missed 3s late in the 4th quarter of Game 7 vs Miami. Brad literally preaches go for singles, not home runs. If they didn't listen to Brad in that situation, they aren't going to listen to Noah or Crawford. 

The top two trades...I'm not sure if those would even be agreed on. Maybe the Memphis pick would've enticed Detroit but I don't think its enough for Rose, who had a fantastic year. Semi and a pick are severely undervaluing what Memphis wanted (they ended up getting Justise Winslow, who I think is straight up better than Iguodala at this point)

I think you can certainly argue the Celtics prioritized young players like Grant and Romeo. I think you can argue they could've prioritized picking up more veteran talent. I remember reading reports on how they were high on a few buyout candidates such as Tristan Thompson or Marvin Williams, but it just didn't work out."
0,Get_your_grape_juice,1601600610,"It just boggles the mind, that this is a hill some Boston fans are committed to dying on.

**1) Leaving for less money:** I mean, don't we usually crap on players who simply take the biggest available payday as simply being ""in it for the money""? And that they ""don't care about winning""?

**2) To a rival:** Dude had just helped the Celtics win their first title in 22 years. Then he got traded. The trade fell through, yes, but Ainge had already committed to it. Can you honestly *blame* Ray for being upset at this? He was, essentially, fired. And then immediately unfired when the deal fell through.

So Ray now had a team *who he'd helped break a title drought* who didn't want him, and another, even better team who *did* want him. I mean, why the hell *wouldn't* he leave? Out of ""loyalty""? To who? The team that just tried to ship him out anyway? I mean, fuck *that* though, right?

Additionally, Ray came to the Celtics because they were building a superteam, and it gave him his best chance at a title. Fast forward to Miami. Now *they're* building a superteam, and now *they're* the best chance at another title. Ray was a hired gun for us. Once Ainge and Doc decided Ray had outlived his usefulness, they tried to get OJ Mayo. Why should Ray be any more loyal to them than they were to him? The hired gun got hired by a team who actually *wanted* him. We really gonna act surprised, and feign some sort of deep offense at this? Please.

**3) Every player has a price:** Sure. But this works both ways. Ray's price wasn't monetary at that point. He got a ring, his team got their banner. Once his team tried to trade him, why should he feel any guilt for leaving on his own terms? Ray's price was his dignity by this point. Ray's price was his free will. His self-determination. His quality of life.

And then KG/Pierce are going to act like Ray broke up some sort of tight-knit family? Please. This ain't the Waltons. I love KG, Pierce, Rondo, etc. But they've been *insufferable bitches* about Ray's departure for years now. And of course, a certain segment of Boston fans have followed suit. And all I can say is stop. Just stop. It's embarrassing. 

Ray can make grown-up decisions about his life because he's a grown up. It's time for the fans and players who still hold a beef against this guy to put on their Pull-Ups, and deal with it.

* Crowder is paid 7.8m
* Solomon Hill is paid 13.3m
* Iggy is paid 17.2m


We could offer them 100,000,000 picks. We still couldn't legally trade Semi for any one of those three other players, let alone all three of those players.

0,-Zaytoven-,1601594817,"I wrote this in a previous thread, but I‚Äôll just copy and paste because I think it‚Äôs relevant.


**Finishing** - He‚Äôs just not a good finisher right now. Who knows how many more layups he would‚Äôve missed without those Theis seals. A lot of the time it feels like his offensive production depends on if he can get to the rim that night.

**Consistency** - We all know when he‚Äôs playing his game, he‚Äôs a top ~15 talent. But he just shouldn‚Äôt have the 2/18, etc. games anymore. He needs to be on his game from minute 1 to 48.

**Assertiveness/Shooting more** - From this point on, any game where Tatum doesn‚Äôt take 20 shots a game, we bailed the other team out. He should be coming out of every game knowing he‚Äôs the clear cut number one option and he won‚Äôt be getting hijacked by Marcus Smart jacking up 3s. Also, I‚Äôd love to see him drive more. His ref treatment is 50/50, but if he improves his finishing, he will be nearly impossible to guard.

**Being better at separation besides blatant push offs** - It feels like he gets at least one offensive foul a game. It would pay dividends if he could learn to hide his obvious push off a bit. A push off is a veteran move, I don‚Äôt think he should abandon it entirely, but he relies on it too much and is terrible at hiding the obvious foul.

I‚Äôd also like to add this one, I didn‚Äôt have it in my previous comment.

**Free Throw shooting**: Hes way too good of a shooter to be shooting only 81% from the line. I think it‚Äôs safe to assume he‚Äôll get even more star treatment from the refs this coming year, we even saw it a bit this playoffs. So, he definitely needs to improve on that front. 


Other than that it‚Äôs mostly just polishing skills. He has the *foundation* of a complete package MVP candidate player. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs an MVP candidate right now but he‚Äôs really close. 

If he put up the numbers he had in the playoffs, he‚Äôd certainly be in the conversation. Though, he won‚Äôt play as much minutes, his efficiency should go up with how weak most East teams are. 

I‚Äôd also pushback on the ‚ÄúHe needs to be better in crunch time‚Äù narrative that just keeps gaining more traction. This isn‚Äôt a weakness in his game, we‚Äôve seen him hit shots and have huge numbers in clutch games. Unfortunately this narrative is only gonna get bigger over the offseason."

0,DPF000,1601594562,"Yeah a four year window to get the first ring, is reasonable. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you make drastic win now moves that sacrifice the quality of the roster a couple years down the road. 

They weren‚Äôt equally young. Durant and Westbrook were both already 23 the start of 2011-12 seasons. Westbrook was in his 4th season and Durant his 5th. This was Tatum‚Äôs 3rd season and Jaylen‚Äôs 4th. Tatum will be 23 the start of next season.

Durant had an extra two years of experience on Tatum and was a year older. 

They never went back for a few reasons. 1. they made the idiotic Harden trade. 2. They ran into a rebooted Spurs team that is better than anything currently in the East. 3. Injuries. 4. Choked a 3-1 lead in the 2016 conference finals.

Pierce was the Celtics for the 2000's, and KG brought a different type of intensity on the court only seen by few in the history of the game.

Not saying Tatum won't spend his entire career in green, but it's a business. If Milwaukee calls up and says, ""Hey, we'll do a straight up swap: Giannis for Tatum,"" then Danny Ainge will personally drive Jayson to Wisconsin. 

On a final note, I go back to something I've said for a while: ""Assets"" are great. Draft picks are great. You have to use them though. The Celtics could have AD right now. Difference between a Finals appearance and losing in six in the ECF during an all-time weak EC playoff lineup."

Strength probably partly plays into this, but I don‚Äôt think he has big hands for his size, so he needs to learn some more craft. 

He‚Äôs too talented to not learn how to do that so I‚Äôm pretty confident. 

But it was always pretty clear against elite drop bigs or teams that actively took away his pull up 3 that he struggled to finish.

0,SmartBrown-SemiTerry,1601589458,"Continue to elevate his playmaking. Was the best part of what he did this playoff run. In addition to that, I want to see him get better at some of his shot selection choices still, especially when facing defenses like the ones we saw in the playoffs. Same thing with end of game. I get that he wants to take the clutch shots, but it's less about the clutch shot and more about the clutch play. Sometimes you can do everything right and the best option isn't to take the contested step back but rather to use that gravity to make a pass for a better shot, or at least drive to try and get the foul.
  
Most importantly, I think he needs to continue to get stronger. Less of the arm push off fouls and more finishing through contact at the rim. Right now he's still doing the finesse game for his lay ups and it seems to not only deter him from driving more often, but it also seems to lower his efficiency around the rim. He has to become more dominant in that area.  

Finally, less complaining with the refs. You want to go plead your case, do that. But none of this whiny stuff that makes them less likely to help you out. You're almost a superstar, but you're not there yet. Don't demand the calls before you've earned them.

For example if Dallas is able to get an all star with their max slot suddenly they become title contenders and possibly one of the favorites.

0,LarBrd33,1601586422,"I'm sure i told this story before.  I was at a local gastropub around where I live in Bellevue, WA maybe like 4 years ago.   Scal and his wife sat down at the little lounge table right next to mine.  Close enough that I had to squeeze by his seat on my way to the bathroom.  On my way back, I felt obligated to mention I'm probably the biggest Celtic fan in the state of Washington and watch his broadcasts every game.  I didn't realize he actually is from Washington State and has a home over here.   

He was extremely friendly.  Exactly like he seems on TV.  Unless he's an amazing actor, he seemed genuinely excited to talk about the team.  We sat there talking about about some of the young prospects at the time like Jordan Mickey for maybe 5-10 minutes... and I got the sense he probably would have continued chatting with me about the team indefinitely, but the dude was obviously there to enjoy a night out with his wife, so I politely said my goodbyes and turned around to leave him to it.  I'm a big Scal fan.  That dude is great.

Side note 1... so during that same exact month I was at getting dinner with my wife at our local bar and grill.   At some point, a familiar looking average-sized guy and his drop-dead gorgeous wife walked by me to go to the outdoor patio.  I mean, she was just wearing a sweatshirt, but noticeably very attractive.  And I'm like ""Weird... that guy looks super familiar... I wonder if he's a software developer at my company.  Why is his wife so attractive?""   I went back to my meal and like 15 minutes later I noticed a bunch of commotion with the servers.  They were all freaking out.  When mine came over I'm like, ""You guys alright?  Hah... looked like you were all having a collective panic attack or something?  Everything ok?"" and the server is like, ""oh yeah yeah... yeah... we're fine.  We're fine.  It's just... the entire Seattle Seahawks team is on the patio.  They usually give us a heads up so we can prepare and comp them drinks and stuff... but they just showed up unannounced!!""  ... Then I put it together in my head... the couple who walked by me was Russell Wilson and his wife Ciara.  Made sense.  I only bring this up, because I basically shrugged off that entire event like ""meh... entire Seahawks team... who cares"", but when I spotted Scal a couple weeks later, I nearly lost my mind.  

Side note 2:  A couple blocks from that Gastropub was an old beat-up strip mall with some very mediocre Chinese restaurant.  They recently decided to tear down that entire city block to put up another tower, but anyways... 6 years ago I got an excited text from my buddy who was at the restaurant and he's like ""OMG!!... BILL FUCKING RUSSELL IS SITTING ACROSS FROM ME  WITH HIS FAMILY!!""... For a split second I briefly considered walking over there since it's like 2 minutes from my condo, but... I knew it was literally his 80 birthday.  Definitely wasn't to bug the man on his 80th birthday when all he wants is to enjoy a delicious pu pu platter with his family.   He lives over on Mercer Island which is like a 10 minute drive from here.  

Side note 3:  Umm.... Russell Wilson -&gt; Bill Russell ... I also met Bill Simmons in New Orleans during Super Bowl Weekend one year, but he was kinda standoffish.  I think he thought I was paparazzi.  I met Neil Patrick Harris the same night and he was super friendly.  His husband and I danced next to each other at a Jazz club all night while Neil watched."

Don't fucking get on Ray's ass for leaving -- Ainge wanted him gone as it was. Ray just took the fucking hint, and left on his own terms.

I'm not going to bitch about a grown man making the best decision for himself, and it's utter bullshit that so much of Boston, and KG/Pierce hold this childish grudge against him.

He left. *So fucking what?* Get over it already. This is fucking embarrassing."
0,solarscopez,1601586129,"Saw Jayson Tatum at the Natick Mall a few months after he was drafted in the summer, was out getting some clothes for the upcoming semester. Wasn't really a long interaction - just wished him good luck for the upcoming season and if he was gonna bring a title to Boston. Said thanks and that he was on it lmao. 

Didn't take a picture or anything because some middle school/high school aged kids started pestering him, so I left to continue with my shopping."
0,TheJaylenBrownNote,1601585977,"I mean the problem is it‚Äôs hard to get someone to 20 shots who can‚Äôt run PnR or iso very well - which he currently can‚Äôt, and play type ppp numbers back that up, don‚Äôt really want to argue about that lol. 

For example, Klay‚Äôs max shots per game is 18. 

So it‚Äôs either get him more involved as a roller, which I do encourage, or basically let him play through growing pains in PnR ball handler/iso situations against bad teams. We‚Äôre too good to let him experiment against good teams.

As someone else mentioned, cutting is another option, but not sure that‚Äôs a consistent source with how our offense works."

0,RUA_bug_Bill_Murray,1601584553,"I met the 2008 Celtics at the airport.

I flew to Toronto to visit a friend and also catch the Celtics (purposely coordinated my trip to be for when the C's were in town).     On my return flight home back to the US, I'm standing in the extremely long security line for international flights to just enter the security area, when security suddenly opens up a special line and about 10-20 people were ushered through.  Mostly white, averaged aged adult males (aged 20-45???), but a couple of really tall people, older (like 50+) people, I thought maybe they were some college basketball team and the old, tall guys were the coaches/trainers?

Then it dawned on me, that was the Celtics media people.   The tall guys were Cedric Maxwell and Tommy Heinsohn.  After several more minutes in line, I get into the security area and some of them are still in line going through the metal detectors so I go up and say ""you're the Celtics!"" (to a group of nothing but media people).  Tommy, Max, and Mike Gorman had already gone through the line, but Greg Dickerson (he was Abby Chin before Abby) shook my hand and had a brief convo with me (I totally blanked on his name at the time, the only name I could think of was Gary Tanguay but I knew that wasn't his name).

Since they were in the VIP line, they got right through, while it took me about an hour to get the rest of the way through security.  After I got through security, I said let me walk to the gate for Boston departures, maybe I can talk to Tommy or someone else if they're sitting there.  So I walk all the way down the concourse to the Boston gate, but nobody was there, so I walk all the way back down the concourse to a restaurant right by security.

As I'm walking, I pass one guy, and instantly recognize him.  ""Hey your Scott Pollard,"" and stuck out my hand, he shook it, then kept walking.

I was in awe of just meeting him, then I like at the security line and see all the rest of the players are there going through security.  Jaw hits the floor.  Put my carry on down and took out my Celtics Garnett T-shirt I had worn to the game the day before and put it on.  I called out every player as they walked by and they all shook my hand.  I remember saying to Garnett, ""look I got my Garnett shirt on and everything"" and he said ""I see that"" lol.  I met Pollard, Garnett, Rondo, Tony Allen, Pierce, Big Baby, Perk, Eddie House, James Posey, Leon Powe, Gabe Pruitt, and Brandon Wallace.  Only did meet Scal and Ray Allen (injured).

They were all nice and shook my hand, but I remember James Posey was the only one who seemed engaged in conversation with me and interested in what I had to say (I said something like I'm glad you decided to come to Boston).

Tony Allen had a big head, literally, not figuratively speaking.

Didn't notice Rondo having large hands.  I'm 5'11 and I thought I was about 2"" taller than him.

Gabe Pruitt and Brandon Wallace seemed surprised I knew who they were.

I told Brandon Wallace I can't wait to see him play and I know he's going to get a chance soon (he was cut the next day lol).

I'm in the US departure section of the Toronto airport, and nobody seemed to care but me.

No pictures, no autographs (not my thing), didn't want to be a bother, just happy to meet them.  Now my flight's boarding, and all I want to do is call all my friends and brag, but you know how it is ""turn your phones off"" lol.  So I had to sit on my 90 minute flight to Detroit (layover) before I got a chance to start telling some of my friends.

To think, I was initially happy just to have talked to Greg Dickerson."

You are completely right that there is tons of value in this draft but we just don't have the luxury of picking and developing that many players. I keep Waters, Edwards, Semi, and Tacko and push all our picks in and go after Hayes/Okongwu. The chemistry on this team is phenomenal and I don't think adding a bunch of rookies that won't ever play is worth risking that.  

Just my opinion."

If Tatum didn't share a team with literally 3 other players averaging 17+ points, he would have easily scored 30+ per night without question and a points vs points comp would be a non starter.  You stick Tatum in Paul's place on that old Celtic team, rack up his minutes to 40 per game and give him additional touches, he should have no problem matching/surpassing Paul's scoring output.  Tatum's an unbelievably gifted scorer with a more diverse and advanced move-set than Paul ever had and additional size to get his shot off against any defender in a way that is more comparable with Durant and Dirk.

The other part lacking, if you compare 21 year old Tatum to 24 year old Pierce by evening out minutes or possessions, it tells a different story.

**Per 36 Minutes:**

* Tatum:  **24.6** points, **7.3** rebounds, **3.2** assists, 1.5 steals **.450**/.403/**.812** - TS% - .567  / eFG% - **.527**

* Pierce:  23.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.8 assists, **1.7** steals .442/**.404**/.809 - TS% - **.570** / eFG% - .508


**Per 100 Possessions**

* Tatum:  33 points, **9.8** rebounds, **4.3** assists, 2 steals, 1.2 blocks .450/.403/.812

* Pierce:  **33.7** points, 8.9 rebounds, 4.1 assists, **2.4** steals, **1.4** blocks .442/**.404**/.809 

Also, very worth mentioning that Tatum's stats for the full season do not reflect the pretty significant leap he made after Jan 11th.  In the 47 games since that time, he's averaged 26.3 points, 8.1 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.3 steals, 1 block 46.4% from the field and 43% from three. Legit All-NBA selection. In the playoffs, he took it up an even higher level... averaging 10 rebounds over 17 playoff games. Over his past 12 games he also unlocked the final aspect of his game - playmaking for others. He averaged 6 assists during that stretch.

* **Paul's playoff stats that season:**  24.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, 4.1 assists .403/.288/.764 in 16 games (42mpg)

* **Tatum's playoff stats this season:**  25.7 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists .434/.373/.813 in 17 games (40.6mpg)

None of this covers the advanced stats that showed Tatum as by far our most impactful player on both ends of the court.  Defensively, he was a monster.  The truth of the matter is this... regardless of the stats, which favor Tatum, it's clear Jayson Tatum is already a better player than prime Paul ever was.  There's few things that prime Pierce does better than 22 year old Tatum.   Tatum should have been 2nd Team All-NBA this season (something Pierce only accomplished once in his career).  

And lastly, it's very important to note that Tatum accomplished all of this while being at the same point in his basketball development as a 21 year old rookie Paul Pierce averaged 16 points for a 19 win Celtic team.

Tatum was a better High Schooler prospect (Tatum was a 5 star recruit in top 3 of all rankings).

Tatum was a significantly better College Freshman.  

* Tatum Freshman:  16.8 pts, 7.3 rbs, 2.1 ast, 1.3 stl, 1.1 blk, .452/.342/.849

* Pierce Freshman:  11.9 pts, 5.3 rbs, 1.8 ast, 1.3 stl, 0.8 blk, .419/.304/.606

An NBA rookie Tatum was significantly better than a College Sophomore Pierce. 

A 2nd year NBA Tatum was significantly better than a College Junior Pierce.

And a 3rd Team All-NBA Tatum right now is significantly better than Pierce was a rookie.

*And before people give me shit comparing them on an age scale, it's the same reason why it would be unfair to say 3rd Year Tatum is superior to 3rd year Kobe (who averaged only 19.9 points, 5.3 rebounds, 3.8 assists)... Kobe, having skipped College entirely, was a year ahead of Tatum in his NBA debut... so it's more accurate to compare 21 year old Kobe (4th NBA season) with 21 year old Tatum (3rd NBA season), 21 year old Dirk (2nd NBA season) and 21 year old Pierce (1st NBA season).  As their bodies mature into adulthood, players make leaps from age 18-22 regardless of where their basketball development takes place*

Ultimately Tatum is likely a better player right now in the infancy of his development than Pierce ever was."

* Isaiah was a sweetheart. It was ~80 degrees out so he was out to promote ice cream.

The wait was pretty brutal since some people waited simply to get free ice cream lmao. I was scared he'd leave on time since it was really hot, but after waiting 1.5-2 hours, it was my turn. Staff members told me no photos or autographs, but Isaiah happily gave me a hug, signed my reusable Celtics bag, and took pics with me. At the time, we were recruiting KD, so I told him to bring KD to Boston and he laughed and said he'll really try. I wish I said something else now :(.. I love this guy so much, he's also retweeted/liked my Tweets and Instagram posts on multiple occasions.     

* Jaylen was a rook when I met him, so he was nervous and seemed kind of baffled by the response of his promotional event. I Ubered there really quickly but there was already a massive line. Like IT, he stayed for hours after the originally scheduled end time of the event so I got to meet him. He signed a basketball and photo and took pics with me. He was pretty patient about it too, since I had to ask someone to take our pic since I was alone. I think I scared him since. I was all over him lmao. I was in such awe that I accidentally walked out of the store without paying for the basketball.  


All in all, great experiences. I went to a couple of events to try to meet Tatum but he always leaves right at the end of the event and his lines are infinitely longer with his popularity.

Some things were massive mistakes by us, such as the turnovers, low effort defense for long stretches, iso-ball, etc.

The nets have a great chance to be the #1 seed, the bucks will make roster moves for no other reason than to keep Giannis, and the sixers will hire a much better coach in Doc or Dantoni. 

If we dont make moves to shore up our two weaknesses, we're putting everything into the 'maturity' basket of our young team, which could work or could have us in a similar position next year, as we wait out the championship window of the bucks, nets or sixers."

If you go look at the advanced stats on the two [here](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_select=Myles+Turner&amp;player_id1=turnemy01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;p1yrfrom=2020&amp;player_id2_hint=Daniel+Theis&amp;player_id2_select=Daniel+Theis&amp;player_id2=theisda01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;p2yrfrom=2020#stats-advanced::none), it's pretty neat. 

Turner is less foul prone (who isn't?!). He gets to the line a bit more and he attempts more than twice as many threes, but that's about all you can say for him. Theis is the better rebounder, the better passer, the less turnover-prone. Theis definitely has better touch around the basket. Turner get more blocks, but it's not clear that those blocks go along with more deterrence... opponents have about the same paint percentages but they take more attempts against Turner."

0,empiricsnothysterics,1601574315,"Yes, upperclassmen are more developed players. But the idea that you can plug in role-players immediately is really risky. Take the top ""he's going to be a role player and that's alright"" pick in last year's draft in De'Andre Hunter (coming out after his redshirt sophomore year). He actually had a really good rookie year, but watching him made it clear that he's still developing into that role, he's not just a set-it-and-forget it consistent role player to begin with (and Cam Reddish who was raw as hell coming out graded worse but similarly). Rui Hachimura was an upperclassman coming out, and to what degree you'd call his future that of a ""role player"" is debatable, it was clear he was still dramatically learning and developing throughout the year. Cameron Johnson for the Suns developed throughout the year, getting better throughout the bubble. Ty Jerome was developed, but just not really good enough. Thybulle had a good season overall as a rookie, but there were times that even his calling card skill (on ball defense) wasn't playable and his 3 point shooting came and went dramatically. The best upperclassmen draft pick last year in Brandon Clarke wasn't good in the NBA this year because he had a clear role player fit (he wasn't even the most ready rookie on his own team). He was good because he was just a really good player overall. And he still looked plenty raw at times with room to grow. 

My point isn't that older players aren't more ready on average, because they probably are. It's just that even with that, you're not likely to get a ready-made consistent role player off the bat. All draft picks need time to develop. The player who are ready to contribute the most in their rookie year (Ja, Zion, Herro, Clarke) are just the best players. 

Overall, very very few rookies are ready to contribute to playoff teams in their first year. This year it was basically just Tyler Herro and Darius Bazley (Thybulle couldn't get off the bench in half the 76ers games). The year before it was basically just Shai. Every draft pick needs to develop and the rookie who can contribute to a playoff team immediately is probably just good (like Tatum his rookie year) as opposed to old."

0,DPF000,1601573044,"He stockpiled picks to build out this team. Part of it is because rookie contracts, when you hit on a player give you a very good value. If he hit on his earlier lottery guys (Smart, Jaylen, Tatum) he knew they would command large contracts. So later lottery picks, like the one acquired in the Tatum trade down (became Romeo) or this years lottery pick acquired way back in the Jeff Green deal gives the team an opportunity to try to acquire a player who in a couple years would be of a level unaffordable to the team on the free agent market. It might have felt like mindless hoarding, but it was anything but. Ainge is no dummy. He took over in May of 2003 and had a championship roster built by start of the 2007-08 season.

One interesting thing is that the Clippers and Nuggets kind of both had the pieces the other was missing to be an elite team.

0,mondomovieguys,1601571816,"2002 was arguably Paul's best season.  

He averaged **26.1 pts**/6.9 reb/**3.2 ast**/**1.9 stl**/**1.0 blk** while shooting 44.2/**40.4**/80.9  

His eFG was 50.8 and his **TS% was 57.0**

Tatum's best season was obviously the one that just ended.  

He averaged 23.4 pts/**7.0 reb**/3.0 ast/1.4 stl/0.9 blk while shooting **45.0**/40.3/**81.2**  

His **eFG was 52.7** and his TS% was 56.7

Pierce led in four of the five major statistics, but he also played almost six more minutes per game (**40.4** compared to 34.3).

He also took slightly more shots per game at **19.5** compared to **18.6**.  Tatum took more threes at **7.1** compared to 6.3, while Pierce took a lot more free throw attempts at **7.8** compared to 4.7 for Tatum.   

Overall I would say Pierce had the better season considering he took a considerably weaker team to 49 wins and game six of the ECF, albeit in a historically weak Eastern Conference.  It‚Äôs important to remember though, Pierce was 24 in 2002 while Tatum was only 21 for most of the 2020 regular season."

**First round**: Celtics take Embiid from the Sixers. Heat take Turner from the Pacers. Bucks take Fournier from the Magic. Raptors take Caris Levert. Lakers take Dame. Rockets take CP3. Nuggets take Donovan Mitchell. Clippers take Doncic.



**Conference Semi finals**: Celtics + Embiid beat Raptors + Levert. We take Lowry with us. Heat + Turner beat Bucks + Fournier. Heat select Giannis. Lakers + Dame beat Rockers + CP3. Lakers select Harden. Clippers + Doncic probably beats the Nuggets, but to keep the same finalists lets say Nuggets still win and bring Kawhi with them.



**Conference finals**: Heat + Turner + Giannis beat the Celtics + Embiid + Lowry, and they take Embiid with them. Lakers + Dame + Harden beats Nuggets + Kawhi and take Kawhi. Side note: Lakers + Dame + Harden vs. Clippers + Doncic + Jokic would be insane but I think the Lakers still win.



**Finals**: Heat roll out a starting five of Dragic - Butler - Giannis - Adebayo - Embiid with a bench of Herro - Robinson - Iggy - Crowder - Turner. Lakers roll out a starting five of Dame - Harden - Kawhi - Lebron - AD with a bench of Rondo - KCP - Green - Caruso - Kuzma - Howard.

The Celtics have a brighter future than present, seeing as the best players on the team are 22 and 23 and will continue to develop. This doesn't mean that you can't make moves to try to win a championship now, but when your best players are not yet fully developed, you aren't really in a position where you can go all in and completely ignore the future.

Actually watching both Grant and Precious at multiple levels of their basketball careers, HS/AAU/College/tournaments. 

&gt;You have presented no evidence of any sort.

It‚Äôs not my job to write tailored scouting reports so that you can understand something blindingly obvious to anyone who has scouted both Precious and Grant. You don‚Äôt even have to be a draft guy to see the problem with your comparison. 

But sure I‚Äôll help you out. Here are some excerpts from scouting reports that come up when you google ‚ÄúPrecious Achiuwa scouting report‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrant Williams scouting report‚Äù

**Precious Achuiwa**

‚ÄúNot someone I want making decisions out of the post, or creating for himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a very good passer in the halfcourt, vision-wise, touch, or accuracy.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTendency to play as a ball stopper and want to play isolation ball‚Äù

‚ÄúStill raw; Needs to improve overall feel and IQ‚Äù

‚Äú87 turnovers and 30 assists‚Äù

‚ÄúHunts for his shots and predetermines when he‚Äôs going to come down and shoot, rather than feel out the situation.‚Äù

VS **Grant Williams**

‚Äúwith the outlier IQ he has‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh level passer for a big. He does an awesome job reading the defense and not only hitting an open man, but hitting the right man.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery good defender with a very high IQ.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGreat rotations on defense and does a great job helping when someone gets taken off the bounce.‚Äù

‚Äúhis rim protection is based on timing and rotations (really smart rotations for charges and just contests)‚Äù

‚ÄúVery high IQ defensive player. Rotates really well in the paint and can pick up slack on the perimeter. Draws charges well. Does a great job playing in help defense ‚Äì the pin, tagging off ball, etc. Does a nice job tagging the roll man and getting back to his man.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat competitor with feel for the game ‚Ä¶ Above-average facilitator/playmaker, especially from the post where he has great vision and makes the correct pass out of double-teams‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh basketball IQ which leads to his above-average playmaking ability‚Äù

This is not a hill you wanna die on."
0,Barrwill29,1601567939,"Lmao what? None of those guys contributed in their 1st season either except maybe Jaylen who got 17 minutes a game in his rookie season.

Statistically you could see where we were inefficient offensively when we allocated plays (looking at you Terry). 


In OP's scenario we'd have 4 clear cut stars and next to nothing else offensively. There would be plenty of shots to go around. We'd still have guys like Tatum, Kemba, and Paul George initiating our pick and rolls who are all 80th percentile or above at it. There are exactly 0 teams that have the wing defender coverage to stop Tatum, George, and Brown at the same time, and our floor spacing would be even better than it is now. 


The Celtics had fewer passes per game and fewer assists per game than they did last season. There is this weird notion that Celtics fans have that we all of a sudden shared the ball drastically better this season when the truth is that we got better at shootig off the pick and roll and driving to the basket.

Precious is probably better at reading the PnR and defending it, but he has a lot of the same issues as Rob. His stance is terrible at times. He bites on close outs. He can get lost off ball if he‚Äôs against a movement big. It‚Äôs a discipline and knowledge issue with him, but that‚Äôs the case for Rob as well. They both have the tools. So if you have confidence in our staff developing Precious, why not just stick with Rob?

1. KAT -  It would be tough to pry Big Kat away from the T-Wolves, it would take a decent amount of draft picks, and their pick between KW and GH. But, I think he would hands down the best big for the team. Checks every box we need. 

2.  Vucevic - This seems most reasonable. Magic need a PG and SF, and I like his contract. Vucevic‚Äôs contract gradually declines, while Big Kat‚Äôs is a financial commitment. I like Big Kat a little more than Vucevic, be the latter might be the best fit. 

3. Christian Wood - A very underrated guy, can run the floor, rebound, and has a nice 3 pt shot. Has a great contract, it would be easy to trade for him given our assets. This guy needs to be on our teem next year! 

4. Harry Giles - Well rounded big, played with Tatum at Duke. I think this would be a good big to get and would make Tatum happy. Making a trade for him could help us in multiple ways.

5. Rudy Gobert - I don‚Äôt hate trading for Gobert but I don‚Äôt love it either. Also, there is no way Utah is taking Gordon Hayward back lol and they definitely don‚Äôt need a guard, so it would be hard for us to get him."

However, the shot if we're being honest was an absolute disaster and will drastically limit his offensive ceiling if he doesn't massively improve there, he had about 4 injuries over the course of the season which isn't encouraging for someone who is 20, and his touch at the basket (one of his major strengths coming out) wasn't really there.

0,EnterGalacticWZRD,1601565590,"Not sure if you are trolling or not. I can‚Äôt think of a prospect in this draft less like Grant Williams. Grant Williams and Brandon Clarke were probably the 2 smartest players in their draft class, Precious is probably bottom 3 of all the projected first rounders. 

Precious can sound great in interviews but that all goes out the window when he steps onto the court and makes bonehead rotation over and over. 

If we didn‚Äôt already have Rob, (who is a better athlete and has more skill) and you Reeeeeally believed in the Celtics developmental staff then I could see an argument for Precious, but not at 14."

The Celtics don't run an overly unique scheme that a veteran who has been in the NBA for a few years would be unfamiliar with the concepts.

Thinking about other teams needs and guys that would be good fits, I think the best guys to target would be:

1. KAT -  It would be tough to pry Big Kat away from the T-Wolves, it would take a decent amount of draft picks, and their pick between KW and GH. But, I think he would hands down the best big for the team. Checks every box we need. 

2.  Vucevic - This seems most reasonable. Magic need a PG and SF, and I like his contract. Vucevic‚Äôs contract gradually declines, while Big Kat‚Äôs is a financial commitment. I like Big Kat a little more than Vucevic, be the latter might be the best fit. 

3. Christian Wood - A very underrated guy, can run the floor, rebound, and has a nice 3 pt shot. Has a great contract, it would be easy to trade for him given our assets. This guy needs to be on our teem next year! 

4. Harry Giles - Well rounded big, played with Tatum at Duke. I think this would be a good big to get and would make Tatum happy. Making a trade for him could help us in multiple ways."
0,9Yogi,1601565070,"No, there‚Äôs an excellent video where he does film analysis with Mike Schmitz I believe.  He has good memory and understanding.  He‚Äôs just learning basketball like every other rookie.  He‚Äôs very Grant Williams-y"

0,TheMadManFiles,1601564742,"If you're only including NBA minutes, then sure. I'm including his college play as well, which is why I said what I did. He was the best finisher at the rim in his class, was handling the ball a lot, and was effective at using the PnR. He hasn't had much opportunity to show that in the NBA yet because of Brad and his offensive roles.

He has already shown that he will be a plus defender this year, which always paves the way for more playing time in Brads system.

Brown was nowhere near as skilled as Romeo when he was drafted, the only reason I brought him up is because of his offensive role his rookie year. Brown has improved tremendously over his career, hopefully Romeo follows the same trajectory. If he does Romeo should end up better than Jaylen because he already has some of the skills that Brown is still trying to develop."

He‚Äôs a fantastic player still and I believe he could still play at an all star level, but it‚Äôs kind of not needed with us. Tatum/Jaylen/Kemba is the perfect offensive trio. Grant + Rudy would complement those guys so well. Rudy is the perfect rim protector for our kryptonite‚Äôs and Grant is such a team player/good PNR defender who can cover all 5 positions.

0,macklowe,1601563394,"To add: Brooklyn‚Äôs strength next year is depth, need to also factor in Dinwiddie and Harris who they‚Äôve committed to resign even if it puts them deep in the luxury tax.  Jordan‚Äôs a role player at this point but he provides a body that can handle size.

I‚Äôd take Harris over Duncan Robinson despite his insane first full season for best three-point specialist in the East.  No way Duncan hits 68% TS% again as teams will plan for him.  Harris has averaged 63% TS over the last three seasons, diversifying has offense by adding a solid drive game and is an adequate if unspectacular defender against opposing shooters.

Dinwiddie might be traded to bring in another big but he is also a useful piece that covers a lot of the inevitable rest time for Durant and Kyrie.  His offense is different (elite at getting to the cup and drawing shooting fouls, solid catch and shoot) and gives them a unique look, is surprisingly lengthy and can probably convert into an above average perimeter defender with his length and quickness, especially if he is not being asked to be the main offensive option anymore.

Miami: gotta expect a lot of growth out of Bam, Herro and Nunn. Maybe Robinson as well although as per above I think the league adjusts so he needs to run to stay in place.  Butler will put in another Butler-esque season.  They also have the ultimate X factor of being able to draw premier FAs, and the only question for next season is whether they reserve that dry powder for the 2021 class.

Both Brooklyn and Miami (and Toronto as well) have also done a good job picking up gems off the waiver wire or deep in the draft to fill out the rotation.  Terrence Davis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Matt Thomas for Toronto, Nunn and Robinson for Miami and Joe Harris, Dinwiddie for Brooklyn.  Timothe Luwawu Cabarot could also be the next Brooklyn rotation find as a two-way, playing a role as a backup 3 and D. They had also found a gem with David Nwaba last year who was really taking off when he had the untimely knee injury."

Perhaps roster construction, but 2018, you can't blame Ainge for Smart getting hurt, or for either Hayward injury.

The problem is that the Celtics bungled the fuck out of both his role on the team, and his jumpshot redevelopment. 

He is not a player you stick in the corner every offensive possession. He‚Äôs been an on ball guy his entire life, and unless the jump shot comes around he‚Äôs not going to be a particularly threatening off ball player. Teams aren‚Äôt scared of helping off him when he‚Äôs posted in the corner, they know he‚Äôs not going to punish them. 

As for the jumpshot, they really didn‚Äôt change much at all. If anything Langford form looks worse now than it did at Indiana. His follow through was the #1 mechanic that needed to be overhauled, and instead the fucked with everything else and continued to have him do that weird snake bite follow through where he finishes his jumper with only 50% extension of his shooting arm."

Ideally we go **Maxey** at 14, with **Tyrell Terry** being the second option. None of the other options make sense outside of maybe Cole Anthony. None of the wings or bigs in this range make sense for the Celtics short or long term. 

26 and 30 are interesting. My absolute ideal combination is **Riller** and **Tillman**, but any combo of **Riller/Tillman/Tillie/Bane/Joe** would make sense here. 

This draft can really help the Celtics. There should be good long term Tatum/Brown compliments available at 14, and really good NBA ready upperclassmen at 26 and 30.

For 49 I‚Äôd like to pick up either **Nate Hinton**, a great defender who is the closest thing to Marcus Smart since Marcus Smart, mentally and personality-wise, or **Udoka Azubuke**.

Was Danny really supposed to sign IT to the max? Would you be happy with IT still on the team making $34M this season? Danny made a very shrewd business decision while also trading IT to a favorable situation. It's not Danny's fault that IT's body broke down and nobody wanted to pay him big money.

The game has slowed down so much for these guys and they have the experience to naturally make the correct read or pass or call.

I also don't think Robinson or Herro are great examples considering they have disappeared for entire games this postseason. Last night Robinson had 0 points. In our series he had 3 and 6 point games. Herro had the worst +/- of any playoff player in the last 20 years last game and a couple of horrible TOs to boot. Is Spolstra all of a sudden a bad coach? No absolutely not. Young guys just struggle with consistency and decision making. 

I don't agree one bit that Brad perpetuates some kind of losing culture. This team makes mistakes but not because they are complacent in losing.

The Lebrons have plowed their way through many such players. Going back like a decade, the teams that have beat him in the playoffs haven't had great bigs. He beat Steven Adams and Serge Ibaka. He beat Tim Duncan. He beat Hibbert, Brook Lopez, Joakim Noah, Al Horford, Jonas Valanciunas, Andre Drummond, Myles Turner...

There's really no evidence that the player who puts us over the top is going to be a big. If anything, it's that we need a hall-of-fame caliber shooter or two that are in league with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Ray Allen, and Paul Pierce."

Congrats to the Heat for beating the Bucks and us fair and square - I don't want to take anything away from them - but I will be surprised if they finish top 5 in the conference next season. That isn't exactly the sign of a Finals team. They just happened to play out of their minds in the bubble and are sputtering out now.
0,Aclef,1601555757,"True but part of the way to fix that issue is playing him long minutes in regular season games. Its so hard to improve game instincts in practice.

Not really. Heat are barely even getting open shots. And Lakers are getting all kinds of second chance points. AD alone butchered them in the paint, making Bam look like a child. But AD can also hit the 3 and mid with ease, so there's nothing they can do

&gt;

Heat played the Bucks and y'all.. knowing that they can beat you lot. And they did. But against the Lakers, they are not playing with that same confidence. They were already down by 30 before Dragic went down

&gt;

Then there's that fella, named LeBron. He's the leader and on court coach. 

That shit is so bloody important. Basically like a coach controlling literally everything, but without any timeouts. LeBron is always active and vocal.  

Everyone in the Lakers knows who to follow, and what to do.. when and how. So It's all just simple. Their chemistry is on a different level

0,crashbandicoochy,1601537727,"This comment is tough because I *really* agree about Myles Turner but don't agree about Onyeka or Wendell.

Myles Turner feels like a trap. Sure, he has a lot of the tools to succeed in this system but the Pacers fanbase reaaaally has grown to dislike him. He seems like a guy who has never played consistently close to his talent level.  A really frustrating guy who can put up the numbers that catch your eye if you don't watch him. Considering who we would have to move on from to get him, Hayward or Smart, I'm not in on it.

I would love Wendell on the Cs but not because he'd successfully defend elite bigs right out of the gate. That's extremely wishful thinking. Meanwhile, Onyeka is a rookie. Young bigs regularly get their lunch money eaten on defense for a while in the pros. He's a great long term-addition but not a short term answer to anyone.

The truth is there aren't any available answers, you can't just go out and easily find a guy that matches up well against the best players in the league."

But man, AD and Lebron just abused most of the Heat defenders one on one and I have a hard time believe that 1) The Celtics can score consistently based on the Miami and Toronto series 2) That they can stop AD consistently since they made Bam look like the second coming of Shaq.

0,OswaldCoffeepot,1601534440,"The Heat performed much better in the clutch and were all around mentally tougher. I don't think you can look past the Gordon situation though. I think there's definitely a case to be made for the Celtics winning if he'd never been injured and we had that continuity with all of our players.

That's why I ask about the semantics of your statement. If you can attribute some of Boston's problem to suddenly having to do without someone and then suddenly have to factor him back in but then he plays too many minutes and his ankle still isn't a hundred percent - and I think you *can* - then you can't just flatly state they were the lesser team.

It sucks to be able to say that another team was mentally tougher and it's really tempting to forget they have been playing in the Bubble largely without their family and support networks outside of the League. It's tempting to use the regular post-season language. Mental toughness is always a huge thing for a team but right now it's a giant motherfucking fire breathing mechano-dragon of a thing where to win you have to be able to use the Force to crack diamonds with your mind. It's just not a regular season at all and the asterisk that will come up when we talk about this season in the future (supposing there is a future) is a necessary thing.

To put it another way, if due to outside events all the players had to play wearing flip flops... Is the team that wins better or just better at playing in flip flops?

You can say the Heat were better at winning right now in the situation we have and that because of that they won the series and are therefore better. I can see that point of view. But I don't think they were better in a way that means we need to rethink our roster beyond the usual pre-season turnover."

0,jamesdakrn,1601534253,"Lakers fan here. I do think actually you guys do match up w/ us better - b/c of the wing depth that would have to make bron work on both sides of the ball.

Heat have done well - but there's no obvious mismatch they have on offense to exploit against the Lakers - Lakers guard defense has been pretty good, Vogel did a great  job w/ the defensive system this year and he actually adjusts - the Lakers played great defense vs. Lillard/CJ/Harden/Murray so far. 

But our kryptonite all year has been big wings that would have to make Bron work, especially if you have more than 1 where Bron isn't guarding him - our perimeter defenders - Caruso/Green/KCP etc are great at shutting down PGs and undersized SGs but vs the Jays + Hayward I think you would've given us a bit more trouble."

 So, according to you it was only until after they beat the Nuggets did the Lakers get the recognition as the best team in the league. But in 3 series before the finals, 58 experts total picked their series and only **2 times** did an expert pick the opposing team. And FWIW, both of the series where the expert picked against the Lakers, they picked the series to go 7 games. The narrative of how the Lakers are being doubted is pathetic."

Look, I don‚Äôt care to get into an argument, but Bam is one of the toughest young kids I‚Äôve seen in sports in general. For him to make his pain that apparently obvious I am just assuming he was probably hurting a tremendous amount.

Celtics are the team with a top 10 player, and top 5 offense and defense. The only benchmark they didn't hit was winning at least like 57ish games.

0,Billybaja,1601522920,Not what happened. The Lakers went up 20 and then injuries happened.
0,AngelofVerdun,1601522918,"Celtics swept the Sixers...Bam was dominant but the Celtics lost that series due to mental mistakes (turnovers, poor shooting, giving up leads - nothing to do with size)...and Giannis dominated last year in a series where Kyrie legit gave up. I am not sure how any of that means the Celtics suddenly need a legit big. Do I want them to get one? Yes. But I just don't understand why this series is suddenly making everyone think it is an absolute necessity to win a title."

0,chickspeak,1601522697,"They are Lakers, but LA has no lake"
0,R1516,1601522650,Oh absolutely the Celtics beat themselves. There is something about playing free without expectations though. Abedayo played through his injuries against us though and a big point was made that it shouldn‚Äôt be an excuse. I think I‚Äôm just upset that this Finals is probably going to be boringly lopsided and it seems like Miami‚Äôs already given up
0,shabashaly,1601522630,Yea im starting to really question how good miamis defense actually is. I mean we put up 100+ every game. If it wasnt for the careless unforced turnovers and poor shot selection at times we would easily be close to that 120 per game mark
0,LosWitDaMost2499,1601522600,"I actually want the Lakers to win, because Rondo is still one of my favorite players"
0,ExistingNail,1601522571,It's not just AD. Bam and Embiid dominated in their respective series'. Giannis dominated the Celtics last year.

0,electric_vindaloo,1601522533,"I honestly don‚Äôt think we would‚Äôve faired better, we have the personnel to trouble Lebron, but we can‚Äôt stop AD and if we try to double, then Javale or Dwight would dominate the boards.

0,Undesirable_11,1601522354,"That was only a big issue in game 4 when Herro dropped 30, other than that they were actually shooting the ball really bad, and not even then we could close out our games smh"
0,AngelofVerdun,1601522323,"Also the big in question is AD, who is a top 5 player period. He is ALWAYS going to dominate. Doesn't mean you need a legit big to counter that. Try to slow him down but then play great defense against everyone else and his size won't matter."
0,Nbafan1234000,1601522283,"Because lakers have the big men to still keep the paint locked down. When we would force Duncan to pass out to Bam on those plays, he had wide open dunks. 

ADs presence completely changes the way the Heat guard and how they attack the lakers on offense"

We don‚Äôt have a full size starting center, our 2 best players are 22 and 23, Hayward was hobbled, and Kemba played mostly like shit."
0,TheJaylenBrownNote,1601522225,"Eh, we crushed the Lakers and then lost by 2 and Tatum was the best player in the second game and got like 20 of his 41 on AD on like 8/11 shooting or something. Heat lost twice against them and one they got rocked. Matchups do matter.

Also just that the Heat are not a Finals team historically (49 win 5 seeds with +2.7 net ratings and no top 10 players don't get there, they get bounced in the second round) and I don't think would have been in a normal season (probably would have been the Bucks or us based on what teams get there normally), but the Lakers are and are not surprisingly smacking them.

I mean the Celtics still outscored the Heat by 1 despite losing 2 more games and getting smacked in the last one, the Celtics really just choked more than the Heat are a Finals team."

0,SaveHogwarts,1601522096,"All things being fair, Brad didn‚Äôt shoot contested threes or throw the ball away for points off turnovers. Players have to be held accountable. Some of it goes to Miami‚Äôs defense, some falls on Kemba for too much iso, some falls on Tatum for too much settling, some falls on smart for chucking threes, some falls on Grant for being in the wrong spots, some falls on bad rotations, some falls on foul trouble. 

It‚Äôs not just brad."

Really hope Brad can get this team into a winner team mentality;, keep our leads, stop bricking threes when the other team is catching up, etc."

0,AngelofVerdun,1601521828,"What? Where exactly did I even talk about the regular season with the Heat? Celtics didn't lose the Heat playoff series due to a big. It was poor shooting, mental mistakes/turnovers. Had they won, there is no reason to think not having a true big would have mattered vs the Lakers when they had no issue dealing with it vs the Lakers in the regular season.

0,Billybaja,1601521625,Honestly I have been a staunch advocate for Brad since the moment we got him but you gotta be honest when a guy underperforms and Brad was not good at all. Hopefully he can see that and improve.
0,YouchB,1601521620,Ok
0,R1516,1601521609,I get that but a rookie Tatum went 7 games against Lebron. This is going to be over in 4 or 5

0,chinesefox97,1601521567,I hate the Lakers but I think Lebron is just playing too good. I don‚Äôt think any team can stop them when he‚Äôs playing like this. But the heat right now just look absolutely outmatched.

0,pokeKingCurtis,1601521538,Yea we had Gordon during the regular season
0,On_The_Tweek_Again,1601521531,Nah. Basketball is a game of matchups. Our defense is a bit better than Miami while their offensive is a bit better than ours. I believe we wouldn‚Äôt have let the Lakers beat us by 30pts. It would‚Äôve been much closer. The heat don‚Äôt even look like the same team.

He‚Äôs also good for strength in a defensive lineup but not much speed and he typically gets 2 dumbass fouls and a travel a game too.

Semi (cheap insurance policy, weight room legend)

Edwards (long shot)

Waters (going for back to back G League MVPs)

Tacko (best #15 man since Scal)

**Option 2**

Trade up and draft the best available PG. Killian Hayes or Haliburton. Load manage Kemba. Replace Wannamaker. Short term loss, long term gain. Clear Kanter, Sex Fingers, and Green off the books. Sign the best ring chasing MLE big man off the garbage heap. (Looking at you Tristan Thompson).

I think it's something we should be focusing on, even if we have to trade for it. If you insert that type of player into this system, it opens up a lot more avenues despite that fact that these type of players usually play poor defense.

Our system is based on three ball. So why not go after the elite of the three ball. It just doesn't make sense to me. Even when that player's three ball is failing them on a night, the opposing team still has to guard them, less they get a shot in and get hot. Their presence is always there."

And most importantly I strongly believe Daniel Theis should extend his jump shot. If he can become a pick and pop threat our offense will be in another level next year. Doesn't have to shoot contested, just as long as he can consistently take open jump shots behind the free throw line there will be a lot more easier opportunities for our other weapons in offense.

We've never had a spot up shooter in this modern roster yet our defense and transition is built for it. Hell, throw Steve Novak out there in our offense and we're gold I think because we have such open looks. We need a true shooter who can knock it consistently to where they have to pressure him with double teams, because otherwise it's going in. If we can get that type of player into this system, which there hasn't been since the introduction of Brad Stevens, then we're able to cheat on offense so many ways that that player's defensive skill wouldn't matter nearly as much.

TL;DR: just give this team someone who can shoot open consistently in that upper tier range. It frees us from doing so many other things on offense, because most of our shots are open."

Lest we forget how much of a dog Butler is. He really forced a lot of our players into tough spots.

Credit to the entire team of the Heat putting all their foot on the throttle and just going all out. We also managed to struggle mightily with a zone. And seemed unable to make the right adjustments, I also believe team ball needs to be incorporated more. Smart shouldn't have been taking that many shots; he needs to mix it up and create for others.

Two notes on the MLE:

1. There's no guarantee we will have our MLE, just because we might not have the roster slot to sign someone with it. Really have to wait and see what's happening with Kanter and our draft picks.

2. If we do have our MLE then it will be really really valuable in this FA. 

 Pre-covid, only 7 teams had more than the full MLE available in cap space. Post-covid there just isn't going to be much money going around for people looking to move.

 This will be the reverse of 2016. Instead of teams having to dish out long expensive contracts to keep their talent, there will be teams poaching good players on short and cheap contracts. 

If we have the MLE it could really be a big factor for the top 6-ish teams racing to get better."

0,SaveHogwarts,1601510349,"I know quite a bit about the prognosis, and the physiology behind it, and yes, you‚Äôre 100% correct that most athletes don‚Äôt return to 100%. The most recent comparable injury is probably Rudy Gay, who returned to form pretty well, albeit in a reduced role (his career was heading in that direction anyways). Kobe was an anomaly as well, most likely, but also recovered well even though he was past his prime. 

If Durant was more of a burst athlete, I‚Äôd be inclined to be more concerned. Over the past 10 years, recovery time for a tear or rupture has decreased from 12-16 months to 6-12 months in most cases that are treated properly.  I don‚Äôt expect him to be 100% of the player he was, but even at 85% he‚Äôs better than a vast majority of the league, and he‚Äôs going to have extra time on his side. 

I don‚Äôt pretend to be an expert, but I did go to school for physiology of exercise and I‚Äôm currently finishing a masters in sports medicine. The stigma around certain injuries is a little outdated as far as I‚Äôm concerned. Go back 15 year and a torn acl was the end of a career. Look at Tommy John surgery over the years. Durant got his surgery back in June of 2019. By the time the NBA starts again after a delay, he‚Äôll have had more than enough time to do a full rehab and then some.

Also helps that the guy he went to is known as the best in the country when it comes to foot/ankle/calf related injuries. Team USA uses him, and he‚Äôs affiliated with players in every major sport."

Butler dominated the Bucks with giannis and the Celtics with all their young guns with a supporting cast of hero and dragic. Jimmy brings players up.

Also, their franchise cornerstone, the Maple Dick, is a sneaky 29-1/2 already! Time flies. Iggy is playing on borrowed time and we‚Äôll see how long Jae‚Äôs good shooting will last. 

Their young pieces are Bam and the two shooters but those two older guys are really vital since they provide the gravity that the shooters need to get free and provide the scoring versatility that Bam hasn‚Äôt developed yet, occasional 30-pt games notwithstanding. I wonder if Riley will take a chance and still try to swap 34 year-old Dragic for 35 year-old CP3. That was their previous plan that fell apart.

The bubble was weird. I certainly thought the Celtics could make the conference finals, regardless, but we all knew Milwaukee was a bear for us and they got gentleman-swept by the Heat. It just goes to show how good Lebron and AD are: their team alone has lived up to its seeding (so far). 

We‚Äôll have to see what Philly does. I hope Doc doesn‚Äôt go there. It would he a shamockery to see him coach those wankers and be nice to its wretched fanbase. 

Nets are going to be good if Nash can convince Kyrie that the two MVPs he earned are worth listening to over the championship ring Draymond Green gifted to the Cavs.

Cutting/slashing, pick and roll, and seeking out mismatches on switches. 

Well then, Brad, why continue to switch on all screens? The latter TWO of those three reasons could be better defended by just playing a straight man defense with help. 

I think this was a paralysis by analysis situation. Maybe theoretically the switch everything concept works better. Maybe in *practice* it is more effective. But when it comes down to it, our guys were clearly not on the same page. And this is no ones‚Äôs fault (some of the switch situations were so ambiguous that the man being ‚Äúscreened‚Äù would switch, but no one else even considered that a screen so they just continued to stay with their own men). It was fucking maddening for me to watch. It would have been so much simpler if we just played straight man defense with help. Our players would all know what to do, no confusion. And frankly, this would have suited Kemba so much better. 

Kemba‚Äôs defensive positives are his lateral quickness and his ability to stick with his man sneaking around screens no problem. Let the 6‚Äô0 guy guard a point guard, not a forward or center. Novel idea right? 

Tatum and Brown are great at this too because they have the length to contest 3‚Äôs even while they are being screened."

The exceptions‚Äô values for the coming season depend on the new salary cap, which could be heavily effected by lost revenues from COVID. We cannot combine the 2 exceptions and offer them to 1 player. 

IMO the areas of need are bench shooting, a big with size who can also play defense, and an upgrade at backup PG. 

Not a lot of great options for bench shooting, but Langston Galloway and Bryn Forbes are unrestricted free agents. 

For big man depth, Aron Baynes, Mason Plumlee, and Tristan Thompson are all intriguing options, but they all very well might fetch more than $5.7 million per year on the open market. If Kanter opts into his player option, maybe we could flip him for someone like Robin Lopez. Tyson Chandler and Joakim Noah would bring nice veteran leadership, although you can‚Äôt expect any sort of sustained production from either of them. 

For backup PG, Matthew Dellavedova and D.J. Augustin have been around the block, and Austin Rivers and Shabazz Napier could add a scoring punch, though both are better in theory than in practice."

Besides that it‚Äôs most likely down to finding someone with the MLE. Theis has a team option so he will be back since the contract is a steal. Kanter we will see whether he opts in or not. 

I expect the core of Smart, Jaylen, Tatum, Kemba, Hayward, and Theis to be back.

0,Marcussmartismydad,1601499720,"JB was 2nd on the team in shots in the playoffs, and took two less in the regular season than Kemba. He is basically our second option. Volume wise, I think he's about maxed out for a guy who needs others to create shots.

For example. there are only 2 players in the league this year who took more than 15 shots, and averaged less than 3 assists: JB and Porzingis (JT is there too if you bump it to 3.1 assists, but his playmaking blew up in the playoffs). I think in the NBA you can only get so many shots when you're not initiating the offense.

If you want Jaylen getting more looks, that would need to come from initiating the offense more, which requires more PnR ball handling and more dribble drives, which you're not going to be great at if you can't facilitate. Point being, I really love his offensive role, and don't see how it's increased without him expanding his game.  (Which, for the record, he can! But that's the next step if he wants to improve)"

For me, I wasn't super mad about because I've loved Jaylen since year 1, but I was definitely disappointed he didn't sign that 4/100 offer.

Marcus and Brad are the guys who play the minutes at the 1 and the 2 off the bench. Calling Brad Wanamaker a 3rd string PG when he's pretty much the guy off the bench who plays the 2nd most consistent minutes is more of a case of semantics vs. accurately reflecting his role on the team. In the last 4 playoff games with everyone but Romeo and Green healthy he played the 7th most minutes. 


That's why I find the 3rd string PG argument for Wannamaker so frustrating. He's an above average 3rd string PG for a contender,  but he's a below average 7th man for a contender. We need to evaluate him on the basis of the role he's actually playing for the team vs. the one you think you get when you look at a depth chart."

Smart took too many awful shots down the stretch in both the Raptors and Heat series when it was critical to score. That should never happen. Smart should have been benched the first time he took back to back deep threes with under 3 min to go. Our role players try to play outside of their role and rarely get punished or benched for it.

I was thinking he'd be another Carsen Edwards, but appears to be considerably longer and much more dynamic offensively. I know they are just videos, but if I didn't know any better, I would swear I was watching Trae Young college tape."
0,SiakamIsOverrated,1601491003,"Ok. But now the expectation now is (or at least should be) the ECF, and really should start being the Finals. Anything short of that is a disappointment"

Semi can stay if he becomes the water boy."
