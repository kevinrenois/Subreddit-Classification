He would’ve hated you.

He would have kicked you in the nuts, pimp slapped your face and torn your communist membership card up.

He would’ve also said some other shit that I’m too lazy to write.

Suffice it to say, it wouldn’t have been very nice.

0,Sandyy_Emm,1601860208,"that’s the last thing that you are. feelings are weird. what he’s doing isn’t cool at all, but he’s also allowed to feel what he feels towards who he wants. it’s nothing against you. more than anything, if he blocked you, he doesn’t want you seeing his new life, so stop looking for it. if he doesn’t want you in it, he doesn’t deserve you in it. if anything, be happy you didn’t get a tattoo with him. no permanent reminders. stop hurting yourself. every time you feel the urge, remember you don’t care. even if you did care, no you don’t. make yourself believe you don’t give a fuck until you actually don’t give a fuck. 

i remember my ex always told me he hated taking pictures so he never wanted selfies with me. he got a new girlfriend and made a selfie of both of them his profile picture and it hurt, especially cause i was with him for well over a year and he had been with her for like 3 weeks. it made me feel worthless. but it was such a dumb thing to be upset about looking back. it wasn’t worth the tears i cried that night. he also stopped “wanting to be my friend” when i told him i would never ever ever be having sex with him again and to respect my new relationship. some people suck. don’t hurt yourself over that"

0,359F2,1601859965,"You are beautiful, and you are strong. Going through something like this is possibly (hopefully) one of the hardest things you’ll ever have to do. You’ve gotten some great advice from other very wise commenters, I hope this helps lead you to a better day tomorrow. 

I do want to add a movie you should watch (when you feel a little better or maybe have a friend come over for an old school sleepover) that helped me immensely when I went through some similar things : it’s called He’s Just Not That Into You, now the title sounds mean and none of the people in it are in your exact situation but it’s a funny and upbeat way to try to show you that he clearly is not worth a minute of your time and that someday you will come across the one who is worth your time. 

Also, the music of Lizzo is incredibly empowering, she is a queen and if you listen to her lyrics she’ll show you that you are also a queen. Take care of yourself, focus on you and building your life around what makes you happy. You are going to come out of this so incredibly strong, I know it!! 

You are gorgeous and also brave for reaching out, what you’re going through absolutely sucks balls; but there will come a day when it hurts a little less, and then a day when you think of it a little less and one day you will realize you didn’t think of it at all. Grief is a process and takes time, but you are going to pull through this. Brighter days are to come. You are loved. I also recommend a lot of ice cream and chocolate, bubble baths never hurt either."

0,vanilla1201439,1601856579,"Felt the same way starting college (and have since found friends &amp; a sense of belonging—although it admittedly took a while.) Couldn’t imagine how much worse it is during covid. Go easy on yourself, you’ve been through so much these last few months! 

You’ve already shown a lot of strength and intuitiveness by recognizing and acknowledging that you’re struggling, and asking for help on a non-toxic platform like this shows you’re also really smart. You’ve got this.

This isn’t a space for advice really, but if you want my two cents: There are probably so many people with similar feelings, even across the hall from you. If it’s any solace, there are probably many first-year students who could use a friend too—and it just takes some vulnerability/bravery to reach out and offer to start a connection. (Invite someone to do some socially-distanced activity like playing video games, offer food or a tool someone might need, suggest a study group, give someone a compliment &amp; show interest in their thoughts/feelings/interests, etc.) It’s also equally if not more important to both stay in touch with folks you knew before college, and to find ways to build meaning and fun by yourself. (Starting/continuing a hobby, setting small &amp; large goals for yourself, etc)

It’s a scary time for you right now, and you’ve done a great job at coping with all life’s thrown at you. Your self-awareness, vulnerability, and strength are clear to see, and I wish I had someone like you to talk to during my first year at uni!"

You'll make friends eventually, trust me. In the meantime, my advice is to find an extracurricular activity you're interested in and do that. For me, that's marching band, but anything with other people will do. Just go for the activity at first, not the people. That's why it needs to be something you're interested in. Then, as you spend more time there, you'll get to know the other people, and they'll get to know you. You might also find a Greek organization you vibe with, which is another good way to make friends.

And now, for the toast: you have a handsome face :)

Good luck making friends!"

0,karenrn64,1601855100,"Do not feel like you have to have a crowd of friends if you are new to university. Very few people go to college with a ready made group of friends. For a large number of people it is a chance to be whomever you want to be. Have you always wanted to be athletic? Chances are at your high school, there was a jock group that was very exclusive. Most colleges have sports you have only read about. Want to go into drama? You have a better chance at a college where everyone is new. Just realize that it might seem like people don’t like you because they don’t know you. Honestly, most of the time the most interesting people are the ones who don’t fit the “normal” mode."

0,Alicern,1601854873,"you are valuable. you are important. you are loved, and have such a capacity to love others."
0,Steam__Engenius,1601854779,"Dude. There are plenty of people who will be psyched to be around you. Lots of people who will like you, potential partners if that's what you're looking for. People whose friendships you'll keep for years. I'm very familiar with the anxious thoughts bubbling up when you start higher education and find you're suddenly on your own. 

Identifying why you feel that way isn't always enough. It's a start, but these beliefs - normally stemming from childhood - are so incredibly deep rooted. Changing your inner monologue as it tells you you're not worthy of meaningful friendship is vital. It's so difficult at the beginning and it's a whole lot of work. Neuroplasticity is a fascinating thing - tell yourself something enough times and it becomes true. 

I spent the whole of uni thinking and feeling like this. Before I started all I thought about that summer was that I'd spend the next few years alone - that I'd go to classes, eat lunch, do everything, alone. Those feelings didn't stop. By the end of uni I had many, many awesome friends and was still convinced they all secretly hated me. I binge drank and popped pills to combat those feelings. I wish I'd funnelled that energy instead into telling myself I was worthy of them until I believed it. 

You are worth friendship and love. There's no one else you'll meet over the next few years who will ever feel the animosity towards you that you do yourself, and you can absolutely change your self perception. Start now: whenever you catch yourself iterating that no one would want to be around you. It's such a small thing that makes such an enormous difference if repeated with discipline."

0,whakiki,1601852124,"When someone makes a commitment to another and breaks it it isn’t the other persons fault ever!  In this case you are mourning the person that you thought he once was. He is not someone you were meant to be with because he has no respect for others. He is not to be idolized or jealous over because his own insecurities and flaws will again come to the surface. People aren’t as happy as they make themselves out to be on social media. You have been given a new chance to start over with someone that loves and respects you as much as you love and respect them. You deserve much better than him and in time you will get there. You’re allowed to mourn and be sad; you put a lot of time effort and love into this person. This is not a mistake on your part but a part of really living life. Unless you take some chances you’ll never get to the reward. Each failed relationship takes us closer to realizing what’s really important to us. Be sad when you need to be, work through your anger. But also take the time to realize when you’re content or at peace with exactly who you are and where you’re at."

Here's a little tip which helped me when I lived in halls (UK) if you're ever by yourself in your room and feeling too anxious to socialise, go to the kitchen to make a hot drink or something, in my case Tea. It's a good excuse to go to the communal area where people are hanging out and gives you a chance to make some small talk while you make your drink. If there's a good vibe there, great! You're now there and you can hang out. And if not then you have nice drink/ snack! I didn't get on with my hall mates but that trick give me plenty of excuses to chat with them"

0,kookykayla,1601847814,"I’m sorry you’re having a crappy time, you look like you could do with a good hug. Your hair looks amazing though, I bet it’s super soft and playful. I’m pretty jealous of your eyebrows and you have the most amazing puppy dog eyes. Your skin is so clear and prefect and your nails look really good and well groomed. 

I can imagine you’re a really cool guy given the books behind you and the awards on the wall. You seem sensitive and usually at peace. You are really refreshing to look at. I hope you feel better soon; sometimes you do judge books by their covers and I know just by looking at you that you are a good, wholesome guy."

0,notfromsliders,1601844241,"I had dreams of my ex-wife for close to 6 months after we separated (not my choice). I still have the occasional nightmare a few years later. I wanted to preserve that relationship, however, in your case and mine if they aren’t willing they are not worth your time and energy. Trust me I too daydreamed of killing my ex, but I never would. That’s normal too. Just like anything else your mind plays it out, and rules it out as a means of helping your inner turmoil. As long as you don’t kill the new girl or try your mind is operating fine I would say. Your feelings are always allowed and warranted. 

It’s ok that he blocked you. Fuck Him! I toast you to focusing on yourself!!! Dive into the things that you love! OR help out a friend in need to clear your mind. As long as you go with the intent of dedicating your mind to that friend it will help clear yours on the next step to take."

0,butch_39,1601843675,"Hey I’ve been in the same position…my ex cheated on me twice, I forgave her both times, and in the end she was the one to break up with me. I spent a long time pining for her and trying to get her back, but I’ve since learned that nobody is worth debasing myself like that, especially not someone who treated me like shit. The kindest things you can do for yourself are stop looking at his social media, spend time with friends, and relearn all the things you love about yourself. You can do this, you’re strong and smart and you definitely don’t need someone in your life who doesn’t value you."
0,polarpear11,1601843274,"I'm 10 years out from something similar happening to me. I'm now happily married with one child and another on the way. I still think about him a lot, to tell you the truth but i don't really have emotions surrounding it anymore. I actually am glad it all happened because that experience made me feel so strong and proud of myself (since I had to be the one to break it off with him because he wouldn't stop cheating). Even though it hurt and I didn't want to do it, I let him go and promptly got blocked from all social media and the like. But even so, it was a relief that I had nothing to go back to. It helped me move on. Took me a solid 2 years of not speaking or hearing anything about him but time heals all wounds. You're better than to keep pining after someone that doesn't want you. I know easier said than done but just keep believing that. Let yourself be free."
0,Apo7Z,1601842983,"We were together 6 years and set to be married 3 months before she left. It took years for me to fully move on. It was sudden and I didn't know there was an issue, nor did I ever find out why she left. I felt so completely destroyed, like everything I lived was some farce. I embraced the things I loved and I spent more time with music. I tried to slowdown and figure out what to do with myself and that took time. It has now been nearly a decade. I dont regret what we had and I wouldn't change it. That relationship and that time helped shape me into who I am. Recovering from the shock of losing her helped shape me too. I'm thankful I had a relationship worth so much to me, and I am thankful for what I have now in my life, including what I learned about my self. 

Sometimes it's so hard when you are rebuilding, and part of that is because you are rebuilding your identity without that person. I hope you find your peace and know that you will be healed over time. You are worth loving and deserve to be happy. I can't imagine nor can I know what you personally are going through, but hopefully in sharing my story you know you aren't alone, it will slowly ease and your pain lessen, and if you need an ear, I've got two."
0,beautifulchaos22,1601842335,"Hey OP, I want to second this. When I broke up with my ex last year, I was so tempted to keep checking his Facebook and social media over and over. I was convincing myself that somehow every time I looked, I would feel better, even though I felt worse each time. I realized that looking over and over again expecting to feel better was quite literally the definition of insanity- doing things the same over and over again and expecting a different result. I’m not saying I (or you) was/are insane, it’s just the idea that our emotions and our brains can convince us that “things will be different next time”. 

I hope you can take some time for yourself, and heal and discover things about yourself like hobbies or interests. It hurts like biotch to break up, so be gentle with yourself ☺️"
0,Theangryporkchop,1601841489,"You're better than him. He did you a favor and left you for BETTER opportunities and people to come into your life.

She's spending the weekend hanging out with this guy somewhere (she drove to him, they drove somewhere else together) and now he's giving her the cold shoulder and she thinks he might be seeing someone else. So... She's kinda physically stuck with him till she can get back to her car. One of the last things she needs is me adding more awkward pressure by saying ""hey, I still like you after all this time.""
I'm more concerned about helping her get through the weekend with as little stress as possible till she's at least back home. And even then... I don't know when/if I'll tell her. I just have to play it by ear and take it one step at a time."

0,Blvckmvtvl,1601837440,"Girl, this happened to me. Exact same situation. We’d been together 7 years and were buying a house together and then out of the blue left for his colleague- the girl I had ‘nothing to worry about’, several years younger than me, all the hobbies she had were ones I used to have and he hated. I hated her from the moment I met her (long before this happened) and I hated her for a long time after. 


I promise you- you won’t feel this way forever. You won’t. Allow yourself to mourn it- because that’s what it is, except it’s harder because no one has died and there is no closure and no definitives like you have with a death. Let yourself feel and explore every emotion, grief, anger, sadness- all of it. Over time they stop cutting so deep and become more of an annoyance than a pain. Eventually they just become mundane facts; things that you accept. 



Whatever works for you- personally I had a wild few months- just lived all the stuff I’d missed out on. Spontaneous dates, crazy nights out, more men at one time than I could keep track of until I met my current other half and settled down. Just have fun and focus on yourself when you feel ready for it :) 


I’ve let go of all the anger and upset I was holding on to- not for his sake or her sake, they don’t deserve it- but I deserve it and so do you. You deserve to feel like you’re free of it. 


But I promise you- it will pass, as long as you allow it to."

Hij komt niet terug en dat hoeft ook niet, er is teveel gebeurd en wat je voor ogen hebt is niet wat de realiteit zou zijn. Je hoeft je nog niet open te stellen voor een nieuw iemand maar wel voor jezelf en voor het blij zijn zonder hem. Zolang je je nog bezig houdt met wat hij doet, bijvoorbeeld door hem te volgen op instagram, gaat dat niet lukken en doe je jezelf alleen maar pijn. En trust me, ik heb ooit een brief geschreven en nooit antwoord gekregen en ik heb me daardoor alleen maar slechter gevoeld omdat het die ander alleen maar duidelijk maakte dat ik nog steeds vast zat in het verleden.

Allow yourself to feel good too. Give energy to your favorite hobbies. Your favorite foods. Go see a friend  out of state. Take a road trip. Meet new people. Talk to new guys. And when you're ready, have sex too.

BALANCE.

That's what we all need in our lives. If you can't afford a therapist, journaling helps tremendously. Helps you track your state of mind of a long period of time. Brings reflection and perspective.

You're a beautiful, desirable woman. Some guy probably has already married you in his mind. LoL

Be well.

As hard as it sounds, being blocked / blocking them on everything and deleting pictures is the best thing you can do. You'll still want to contact them but just wait and it'll help tons. The next thing that helps tons is to so things you like to do. This will take your mind off of the situation and will slowly help you forget about it. Best of luck!"

0,mattywadley,1601831492,"Ik doe het even in het nederlands. Pijn over een oude geliefde is vreselijk en op het moment dat je er midden inzit lijkt het alsof deze pijn nooit meer weg zal gaan en je nooit over die persoon heen komt. Maar dat gaat echt gebeuren. Het is geen lineaire stijgende lijn, er zijn pieken en dalen. Maar kijk hoe ver je al gekomen bent in een jaar. Daar mag je trots op zijn! We zijn geneigd de relatie te romantiseren, alleen de leuke dingen willen we onthouden. Ik weet niets over je ex of jullie relatie, maar ik durf te wedden dat je het rooskleuriger inziet dan dat deze eigenlijk was. Dit wordt versterkt doordat je alleen op zn Instagram kan kijken, waar iedereen zijn leven mooier maakt dan dat het is. Neem de tijd voor deze gevoelens en probeer ze uiteindelijk een plekje te geven. Dit is een klein dipje in de grote pad van het leven en er staan nog zoveel geweldige dingen te wachten op je! Hou je vast aan die gedachte, tijd heelt alle wonden en uiteindelijk slijt ook deze pijn."

DO NOT try to get him back. DO invest in yourself instead. Make you your #1. Date yourself. 

You'll find that the more you invest in you, the less you rely on outside sources (like this dude) to validate or bring you happiness. 

You honestly don't need this guy. When you remember him, understand that the way you imagine him is not usually the same as how he actually is. Don't stay in love with a memory or an idea of the person you think he is, its a dangerous trap."

0,Beautiful_Dust,1601823444,"Honey this was a blessing in disguise. What he did for her he will do to her. And next time he cheats, it wont be on you. You deserve so much better. There are men out there who do know the meaning of loyalty. One day youll meet some who will be a loving loyal partner, and you will look back at your ex and wonder what you saw in him. My ex left for a crackho, who used our child as a weapon. I divorced him. I got remarried 3 years ago, and now i look back at my ex and cringe, wondering what i ever saw in him. It gets better, i promise. Hang in there. Karma is a bitch. He will get his. Your best revenge will be finding happiness without him."

0,Masterhearts_XIII,1601822292,"Girl. My ex, 22, who I was planning to propose to, dumped me in March. I have since found out she has moved in with a man she met on tumblr (basically emotionally cheated on me during the last months) who is 50 living in Florida. She used to live in Chicago for reference. I should hate her. I don’t. I am hurt daily. That’s what let’s you know the love was real. It’s never fun, it’s going to hurt, but I’ve been seeing a therapist and it’s ok to FEEL. Your love is valid. It doesn’t mean he’ll come back. It doesn’t mean you should let him. But I will always love the girl that left me. No matter what happens. It’s ok for you to love him too. Just work to move on to another person at some point. The heart is strong enough to love more than one. And only by starting to try, can your heart start to ease off the pressure. This may not be the happiest toast, but I hope it helps."

0,JerBear94,1601818882,"Hey,

Your feelings are valid and deserve someone who wants them from you all all sincerity, regardless of what they are. When my left me (I love you —&gt; I haven’t loved you in a while, overnight) I cried myself to sleep for over a year and also got blocked on everything after reaching out. It’s been 7 years and I still think about him every day.

At the same time, I wouldn’t have met my current partner, and we now live together which has made life so amazing these last 2 years. I think about my ex every day, but I also feel thankful to him (at least a small part of me does) for getting out of the way so I could meet someone better, who does love me. 

You can’t control what your emotions are, not how others respond to their own emotions, but you do choose how you choose to use them. As much as they hurt, they can make you stronger and push you to new heights. I’m still looking forward to the day I casually run into him, with a six pack and Ivy League masters degree I wouldn’t have been able to get had it not been for the resilience he forced on me.

This is only your beginning, and I can’t wait for the story you’ll tell. You’re already more the enough, give yourself the credit you deserve and plan for the future, even if it’s just one day at a time, that makes it easier for you to see just how much of a great catch you are and how he’ll doubt his decision to have left you some day. You’ll have moved onto better roads."

Hang in there. Work hard in school, grow up, get a (STEM) job (or whatever else really makes you happy)  and maybe take up meditation. I wish I would have done so earlier. ❤"
0,karenrn64,1601813956,"You have made it through the first year, all the holidays AND the pandemic! You are stronger than you realize. You are not “at fault” although it might feel that way. He left you for a coworker, a person he was seeing on their best work behavior. You don’t usually see coworkers bloated, no makeup, bed hair, farting, before coffee pissy or know when Aunt Flo comes to visit with all the loveliness that entails. 

So, this year do something exciting. Learn a new language or skill. Get in the best shape you’ve ever been. Learn to love yourself again. You are a beautiful woman although I can see your pain in this picture. 

As to your feelings, everyone has them. Your feelings are as valid as anyone else’s. It’s what you do with them that matters. When my son was a baby, my husband made a negative comment and at that moment I wanted nothing more than to wing the baby’s bottle at his head but I didn’t. Talking about it worked things out. This other woman is not the truly guilty party here (although going for someone’s SO is never a good character indicator), he is. He is the one who didn’t appreciate you. Mourn the loss of being half of a couple, not the man who doesn’t deserve you. 

I wish you a much better year coming up."

.honey breakups are bad but there is always an upside to everything trust me. I'll tell u what I did to get over her.
I started to engage myself in hobbies
I started reading books, i used to love solving puzzles so I did more of that. I started to play lawn tennis.( I highly recommend a Physical activity) and bunch of other stufff. Rnow I have almost 12 hobbies including ( I am decent guitarist now:) 
My point being I couldn't have accomplished all of these without that breakup.
So all I have to say is the best healing way is time. Ik it's hard and it's easy for me to say rnow but trust me I was once in ur position.

0,ner0417,1601802911,"I'll tell you, in my experience, you are much better off without. My ex and I actually fell out of love almost at the same time, after spending years together. I was so lucky to have what you do not, we tried to see if we could get things back in line... We lived together, we slept together, we even stayed together until we just couldn't anymore. We both still loved one another, but we weren't in love anymore. It hurt so badly for us both, but I always told myself the old adage **""If you love something, let it go. If it comes back to you, it's yours forever. If it doesn’t, then it was never meant to be.""**.

She is engaged to another man now, about two years later, and I haven't even been on a date since. But, if I had stayed with her or gotten back with her, I *know* for a fact that I would be worse off. The love that we had... It broke for a reason. A reason unbeknownst to me, but I feel that it reflects the quote above that ""it was never meant to be"". Look into your heart of hearts, friend. Ask yourself, 'was it meant to be?'.

My other ex... She broke up with me for a week to sleep with another man. And I accepted her action as a mistake and we were together again... And she basically did the same again. I very much regretted extending my trust to her, and going back was the biggest mistake of them all. I learned from that one, that maybe the next time I need to just let go when my world comes crashing down, instead of clinging to the tiny strand of security, or comfort, that she represented. It isn't worth your time anymore, after your trust has been betrayed, I promise you.

As I said before, they are in my past, I have let go, and they did not come back to me I am at peace with that now, and I am bettering myself, and I know that you can grow to do the same. Let him make his own mistakes, and show the world what he is missing out on. You have so much goodness inside of you to share, and I very much hope that you find your people to share it with. Nothing can stand in your way as long as you stay strong, okay? Best of luck, and make sure to smile once in a while. :)"

I think that the part of me that is able to love and all that was just shut down and when I was finally ready to boot it back up some emotions came out that had been ""trapped"" in that part of my brain. I gave it time and no I no longer have any feelings about her and what she did.

I am convinced you should not blame yourself. Work on yourself, be the boss b that will make him regret ever hurting you and take advice from everyone here and I promise it will be ok. 
I know it's easier said than done but keep all of this in mind and even tomorrow will be better than today.

I wasn't in a good spot to be hearing that at all, and I think because he knows me, he should have known that. My situation may be different as well, it was an actual break up that he had just witnessed on Christmas, no less, and I was crying. I can laugh about it now, but it came off pretty absurd for a while.


With that being said, only you really know her and how she might react to the information that you like her. It seems like you're planning on seeing how things go after a bit of time, and I think that's for the best. You're handling this well!


I'm sorry you're going through this, I know it must be hard. Protect you heart though, friend. If you think space will be good for you, that's what you should do. You are definitely handsome, and are clearly a gentleman- so know that at least, and don't limit your opportunities with the other fish in the sea!"

I just hope you know you’re not alone in your feelings, and it is so natural to miss this person while also feeling anger and grief at the same time. It’s a lot to hold and it takes an immense amount of grace and strength to be able to do so. Just acknowledging your feelings shows an impressive amount of self awareness and understanding. On a less heavy note, I think you’re really beautiful. You deserve so much more than you’ve been handed, and I am so sorry.

As a dude constantly battling against his own ED, just the other way around, and this being the first year in my life I'm not depressed 24/7, I just want to say I'm really proud of you... Yes, I'm a complete stranger just trying to do some good around this subreddit and I DO am proud of you... So is everyone else in here, I believe... I'm not sure if that'll do something for you, but rest assure, we've got your back... :D  


You're fighting a HARD fight, and you should be proud of the fact that you're doing something about it, because most of thetime it just gets too overwhelming...  


And yet here you are... Trying to do something about it and trying your best to deal with everything you know is holding you down...   


It takes a lot of guts and a lot of vulnerability to ask for help, so... Be proud of that too, that's yours and only yours, and it also deserves recognition...  


I don't think theres a ""right way"" to handle mental health, 'cause not everything works for everyone, but I'm really glad you're working on it... You've got this!  


And again, if you don't... If it gets difficult, if you relapse again or if anything else happens and knocks you down again, remember we'll be here for you anytime you need...  


Everything you're going through, and everything you feel throughout it is normal... It's a hard process and not everyone is willing to go through it... Sometimes it hurts... Sometimes we're not able to deal with the stuff about ourselves that comes out of it...  


And the fact that you're facing the challenge head on, just tells me you're brave, you're strong and you have everything you need to get better... Keep going!  


And don't forget, it is also ok to take a rest from being strong, brave and better... It doesn't mean you're losing ground...

0,vagabondsushi,1601797261,"You're beautiful, like all you facial features are just stunning and that looks like a cozy sweater!  I lost a person a long time ago and I believed it to be all my fault too. And I did try very hard to get them back. I've moved on now. Occasionally, I'll remember happy and sad moments with my exes, which will make me miss the time we had or cause me to relive traumatic events (even if we've both moved on.) It's important to acknowledge those feelings but realize that you can't control the decisions that they made that ended up hurting you. You can control how you react though."
0,papadumsoldier123,1601797230,"Hey don't fault yourself for the relapse. It's perfectly normal to do so. Take it day by day, today you may feel bad, tomorrow too, but the next day you'll feel better. It's baby steps. Take it easy, it does get better!"

You have worth and you are lovely. Cheers!"
0,Is_A_Healer,1601796073,I can’t date someone I wouldn’t want as a friend first. For me a relationship is friendship+ with naughty bits included. In my mind you’re doing the right thing :)
0,MamaKleeMA,1601796038,"Listen, the fact that you are 25 and in college and had enough savings to support yourself and your child for months means you are responsible! That you reached out for support means you are resilient. I’ve been in a place like the one you are in now.
It was devastating and humiliating. I left my abusive, alcoholic baby daddy with $11 in my bank account, a black eye, and literally nowhere to go.
My mantra was: HOLD TO THE CENTER, from the Tao Te Ching. To me it meant like go further into yourself. As you fight for your own survival and the survival of your child, all that is superfluous will fall away. All that will remain when you have passed through the fire is what is good and necessary and true for YOU. 
As a social worker, I have to advise:  Don’t let your ex be a part of your life. They are banned and I will fight them if they try to come near you! GET AN ORDER OF PROTECTION through the courts. It will break your heart and then later you will put yourself back together and be stronger. Also, SEEK PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. There is no shame in doing so. Yours is the exact situation that we’ve created and funded with our taxes social programs like TANF and Medicaid section 8, etc! Get what you need to get you and your baby through this absolute shit storm that YOU DONT DESERVE.
And oh please know that there are so many of us out here who feel your pain and LOVE YOU. We haven’t been through what you are going through because your experience is unique. However, we’ve been through some shit and made it to the other side and YOU WILL TOO."
0,KINGCOMEDOWN,1601795704,"Hey, I want you to know that you alone are worth so much more than any boy. Getting over someone you deeply cared about is tough, it takes time. 1 month, 5, 1 year. However long you need to take to process this and handle your emotions is fine. You are doing the best you can in this moment, and that’s all that matters. Take time to fully feel your emotions, so long as you wake up the next day and try again. What is important is that you keep trying. You are important, your feelings are valid. Keep going."

This happened to me about a year ago around this time of year and it’s been on my mind quite a bit. It hurts but as time goes on, it becomes more manageable. Focus on what you enjoy and spend time with friends and family who love you. Best of luck"

0,imgladisaidit,1601792786,"Alright my man. Because of your age, there was no way I was gonna talk about your looks. Besides, that never helps anyone much unless that's the source of their issue. 

So, I did the reddit dive through the user history. I figure if I can't find something good to say, I could just piss off and say nothing.

I did though. You've got a great sense of humor. Seriously, I got a few  chuckles. You don't joke much on reddit, but when you do, it works.

But the biggest thing I saw was strength.

Yeah, I know dude, how the hell did I see that? You're here asking for someone to give a pick me up, and you've been facing some rough patches. That can make a person feel weak and beaten down. But, you keep chugging along, doing what you need to do to get though. And, you reach out for help!

That right there, being able to say ""hey, I need some help here"" is one of the hardest damn things to do. Letting yourself be open and vulnerable is not something that comes naturally to most people. It's a skill that we have to learn, a way of thinking that takes work.

You're doing that work.

So, much respect my man. And I use that word intentionally, with the full meaning. It's a truly adult thing to be in pain and reach out. That's being a man."

0,hmauro57,1601792238,"Mental health in college is TOUGH. It's a lot to deal with and I promise you you're not alone in that struggle. I remember one of my doctors telling me that mental health is like a three-legged stool- medication, exercise/physical health, and therapy. It's amazing that you're seeking therapy. Seriously, it helps SO much with managing stress and learning how to deal with those bad mental health days/weeks/months. 
You're so strong for pushing forward and working on yourself even in the midst of a really really hard time. You've got this 💪 I promise it gets better-this coming from someone who had a suicide attempt in college and understands how much school can take away from time to take care of yourself.
Make sure that YOU are the priority. School is important, sure, but you've got plenty of time to learn. What matters most is that you get to a better place."

0,ephemeralburrito,1601791886,"What's going on man. You and I probably will never meet or know each other in real life, but I saw this post and I wanted to tell you a few things.

First of all I am so sorry for the loss of your mother, I can't even begin to imagine what that must feel like. It takes courage to be able to move on from something like that man, in my life and due to my career I have seen countless individuals who give up on their dreams and life after events like that. Look at you however, you got this without a doubt, don't ever let anything or anyone be able to rip that smile away from your face man. Time will come and things will happen, some good and some bad, but what defines us is how we handle those circumstances.

My man, my dog, my handsome devil, open up a Sodie Pop and go after your dreams man, I am more than %100 sure you're going to achieve great things and I can assure you your mom will be watching, proud and happy."
0,Nutritious_breakfast,1601791437,"I'm sure my experience as a 12/13 yr old is wildly different than yours. But something that may be universal is how you treat others. I can remember ignoring people, praising people, talking shit about people, and even bullying people. Let's throw all that shit out.

I wish I walked into class every day stoked to chat with ANY person. You've got the power to be cool to ANYONE. Just be cool, be nice, don't talk shit unless it's harmless, and even then you check with the mark after to make sure he okay. Spread peace and love. Just operate under the motto Be Nice To Everyone. Even if they aren't nice to you. If you're chill, other people will see it and they will gravitate towards your chill vibes. Bully vibes comes packed with anxiety. Nobody wants it."

It's never truly gone; it's a wound that eventually becomes a scar that will always be there. I'm not going to spout off any platitudes like ""it gets better"" because it really doesn't. You just exist. If it helps at all to know, your existence *does* make other people's existence better or easier. People are happy to have you even at your worst. It seems bizarre to live just to enhance the lives of others, but you're doing that by just passively existing. If you're wondering what's next, let's figure out how to do something for *you*."

It might not mean much from an internet stranger, but you have value. There are people who care about you—and if you can’t think of any, that’s okay, because I’m looking at your post right now and caring about you! I want you to feel the teeny bit better that this comment is able to make you because you’re a human being and you deserve it. Plus, you seem nice! Regardless, though, to me, your value is innate. You don’t need to earn it. Even if you’re laying in bed all day depressed and overwhelmed, you have value. While obviously it’s best for your health and stuff if you are able to go brush your teeth, etc., you aren’t worthless just because of mental health issues. Your worth comes from being a person, but also from things like the passions and values you have and the aspirations you have (or that you might be trying to form).

I might have rambled, but I hope that makes sense. You’re important and worth care (both self-care and care from other people)!"

Though we cannot fill the void your mother left behind, we anxiously, politely, remind you the quiet, healing power of our love pours over you.

0,TheM-AConundrum,1601783913,"I know a lot of people talk about a ""friendzone"", but I personally don't believe it's the bottomless gulf everyone says it is. Sometimes, all a girl needs is a friend who listens without harsh criticism or underhanded slights. I will say that telling her you like her may just be best for both of you: if she's open to a relationship, then you'll know how to proceed. If she's not, that's okay too. Learn to appreciate a solid friendship; if she feels like you expect or demand something more, it will totally turn her away.

So for a while it feels like we've kinda been in this ""will they won't they"" limbo. Maybe that's just in my head. Maybe this is just another record skip in our limbo.

That's great advice, thank you. It just kinda blindsided me because I didn't know she had this thing going with this guy until I asked her how she's been and all of a sudden she's having a bad weekend with him. My knee jerk reaction was just ""Whoa. Chill about your feelings right now, you can feel like shit later. She's obviously going through a lot right now, be there for her first."""

Also, you should be honest and straight up tell her you need some space right now because you've developped feelings for her.

0,defenselaywer,1601768476,"My bestie lost her husband suddenly last month, and feeling awful and anxious is absolutely a healthy response. It shows your emotional maturity. It does get better, but grief can sneak up on you, so you may find some random thing reminds you of her, and makes you hurt like the loss was just yesterday. 
Would you want to write a letter to her family telling them wonderful memories you have? Might help you both.  I did this for the husband and young children of a cancer victim and they appreciated it. 
If the anxiety is severe enough to interfere with the basics of life, it's time to get professional help. It isn't a sign of weakness any more than getting a personal trainer at the gym is. Sometimes a pro can give us direction.

0,callheraddie,1601762466,"Being alone is better than always feeling bad. Honestly, it sounds like your family situation is having a bigger impact on you than you realize, which is probably spilling into your other relationships and straining them. Trust me, nothing is wrong with you and it’s not your fault. I’d encourage you to try and branch out on your own. The absolute worst thing that could happen is it doesn’t work out and you move back with your family. I think you’ll find a lot changes once you get out of that negative environment and can focus your energy elsewhere."
0,cameemz,1601762429,"Thank you.  I feel so crushed because I always thought I could save him.  I was always so worried for his health, especially after his seizure.

You’re so welcome. They are all words of advice I’ve received from others. I too am working on being able to externalize my emotions and talk about it. It’s helps to talk, but it’s hard to talk. 

It’s all easier said than done.

Yes things will hurt for awhile and may seem confusing or if you did the right thing, but just know you are strong. You were able to fight for yourself in this moment, so you will be able to fight for yourself again.

&amp;#x200B;

I know breakups are tough as I went through one myself as well earlier this year, and kind of like you I made a choice to break things off when feeling like I was not being treated like I should.

Toxicity is hard to shed yourself of, but feels great when you do. Keep your head up, I promise things only will get better for you if you continue to care for yourself. If you ever need an ear or just someone to talk with in any manner feel free to reach out."

I have a hard time making any type of meaningful friendships which I desperately crave. Im worried its my fault.  Thats mostly why I want to move away. Maybe I can have a fresh start.

I guess the tricky part about letting friends/family in is then having to let them in on how truly bad things actually got.  Not just for him, I let myself slip down far."
0,Whole-Conversation-6,1601746115,It was July 15th. Thank you for your wise and kind words. I need to do better with externalizing certain emotions that I’m feeling for sure. I wish you all the best as you grieve as well.
0,3v3ntua1,1601746037,I'm so sorry for your loss. And being able to reach out for support is a sign of strength. You'll get through this tough time and I'm confident in due time you'll live a happy life your Mom would want you to have. Stay strong.
0,D41109,1601746029,It’s cruel that we are faced with these challenges in our existence. But it is the nature of things. I am proud of you. You are still becoming something. Don’t let anything hold you back.
0,didibird2019,1601745954,"You should be proud of ending things, it’s really hard to realize someone is bad for you. You have to look out for yourself and make sure to keep in touch with family and friends. I guarantee you can talk to at least one person honestly and they’ll have your back! Pretending you’re fine will only hurt worse - take care of yourself OP. We’re proud of you❤️"
0,thereisSOmuchnoise,1601745918,"You have got an absolutely gorgeous head of hair, a kind smile, and a sexy five o'clock shadow. And that's coming from a lesbian, so take what you will from that compliment. I think it says a lot that you impressed me that much, but that's my opinion, lol. The woman that's right for you will find you perfectly handsome and rugged. Don't listen to those negative voices, friend. As for looking the way you want, be happy with yourself, regardless of how society thinks you should look. Please don't doubt; you are a very attractive man."

0,cameemz,1601745205,"I’ve tried detoxing him at least 5 times over the years.  It’s gotten so bad that earlier this year he had a seizure and was in the ER for days.  I’ve been desensitized and after all the red flags I put my love for him above the scary truth: that he’s been killing himself in front of my eyes.  All the lies and deceit have really broken something inside me.  I’ll never trust like I used to.  In an addiction like this he could straight up look me in the eyes and swear that the sky is purple, and if I questioned it then he’d make me out to be the crazy one."
0,canastax,1601745137,"i don’t know your situation of course, but i think it might be time for them to know the truth so that you’ve got some support. don’t do it alone. good luck..

You have a great jawline and gorgeous eyebrows. If you want to look a bit more “chiselled” keep going with the weight loss and maybe cut your hair a little shorter? I always think wavy hair tends to soften features."

Lose weight or tone up to feel better in your body for you. Yes, some girls like masculine-looking guys, but there are a whole lot of us who like fluffy guys, slim guys, short guys, dad bods, etc. I find  my ""type"" becomes the person I'm with. I like that person, so I am now more attracted to those features in general."

I really wish things mellow down, and you find the strength and courage you need to be the top-notch dad/student you are being right now. It's hard enough to have a full course load, but to raise a child alone must be doubly challenging and we are all proud of you for doing the best you can. And, whenever you go for treatment, be it four months or four weeks (although I wish it were sooner), you will do even better than before. Love and light, buddy1"

0,KingKetchup,1601739821,Don't sell your car even if it's the last thing you own (assuming you have one). If you have a car you can sleep in it (Walmart parking lots are great for this) and store your valuables. Without one you will be starting each day from scratch and it will be much much harder to find work and get back on your feet.

0,FlamingTrollz,1601737728,"Okay.

I say this in support, and politely...

Because nothing unknown is knowable unless we stretch ourself a little harder. If someone says they doesn’t know it is like telling a teach in university / school ‘you don’t know.’ We both know that answer’s not good enough. The prof / teacher will ask you to do your best to answer, and then they will ask you to spend more time studying and trying to work things out. 

Perhaps that’s a question to ask yourself again, and push harder. Not knowing isn’t good enough. Again, I say this kindly. As one person, who long ago also didn’t know ‘why.’

Well wishes. 🙏🏻✨"

I'm confident that knowledge of your strength will carry you through whatever you may face.

And your doing all of this whilst dealing with a tough mental health disease. I take my hat off to you!! Please also note I’m in no way taking away from all the awful things you’re also dealing with. I just wanted to remind you of how well you’re doing especially under such tough circumstances. May I ask if you’ve taken an AVO out against your ex? Reported them to the police? Just for your protection should they try anything again. But know this, you are strong, resilient and you WILL get through this and be an even stronger person for it. I’m wishing you all the very best, please be so very kind to yourself. Ask for help and lean on those who you trust and who want only the best for you. Maybe also seek financial help.

0,von-schlitterbahn,1601725389,"You seem fine, but please do not define yourself by what you are or going Through. Yes Through, life is not static, you grow! 
Here is my favorite quote by the author Jim Butcher....


Sure, we'd faced some things as children that a lot of kids don't. We still hadn't learned, though, that growing up is all about getting hurt. And then getting over it. You hurt. You recover. You move on. Odds are pretty good you're just going to get hurt again. But each time, you learn something.

Each time, you come out of it a little stronger, and at some point you realize that there are more flavors of pain than coffee. There's the little empty pain of leaving something behind - gradutaing, taking the next step forward, walking out of something familiar and safe into the unknown. There's the big, whirling pain of life upending all of your plans and expecations. There's the sharp little pains of failure, and the more obscure aches of successes that didn't give you what you thought they would. There are the vicious, stabbing pains of hopes being torn up. The sweet little pains of finding others, giving them your love, and taking joy in their life they grow and learn. There's the steady pain of empathy that you shrug off so you can stand beside a wounded friend and help them bear their burdens. 

And if you're very, very lucky, there are a very few blazing hot little pains you feel when you realized that you are standing in a moment of utter perfection, an instant of triumph, or happiness, or mirth which at the same time cannot possibly last - and yet will remain with you for life.

Everyone is down on pain, because they forget something important about it: Pain is for the living. Only the dead don't feel it.

Pain is a part of life. Sometimes it's a big part, and sometimes it isn't, but either way, it's a part of the big puzzle, the deep music, the great game. Pain does two things: It teaches you, tells you that you're alive. Then it passes away and leaves you changed. It leaves you wiser, sometimes. Sometimes it leaves you stronger. Either way, pain leaves its mark, and everything important that will ever happen to you in life is going to involve it in one degree or another"

0,dmurrieta72,1601706842,"You look like a really cool person to hang with.  I pray you get through the rough stuff and show the world how great you can be.  Be sure to report the abuse, too.  Crooks will stay crooks and hurt others if the good people just let them get away."

0,HelpfulAndHope,1601705768,"Don’t let depression tear you down. State back at it and shrug it off and do something productive. Got a project? Tackle it! Got a puzzle laying around? Solve that thing! Always wanted to read a certain book? No time better to start. 

Motivation can be a good start to getting out of the depression blues. Once your feet start moving keep moving and I believe in you

There’s nothing you can’t accomplish! Build that character!"
0,HelpfulAndHope,1601705490,"Don’t stress man. You still got many years ahead to make a change if you want to. It’s good to hear you lost weight. If that’s you’re goal than keep at it.

0,Sassbot_6,1601703159,"I'm so sorry you're going through such hard times. None of it is your fault. Being who you are is always a radical -and brave- act of self-love. Believe that the future will be better than the past, cause it always is. You're doing great, even if all you can do is take it one day at a time. Shit - even under the best of circumstances, that's pretty all ANY of us can do."

If you need an extra side hustle on your own schedule, you could try out different things like TaskRabbit, instacart, or shipt (some of which you can take your child with you on) and they’re also very low-human-interaction (helpful with the bipolar!) hope you have access to your meds and take them.

When we give so much of ourselves to others, we’re left exhausted and burned out. Everything you are doing to support yourself and your child and to make a better future for you both is incredible, but please please try to find time to give back to yourself too if you can. You deserve love and happiness too don’t forget. Sending you big mom hugs from Canada. You’re doing great, honestly,  and your child is so so lucky to have such an amazing human being for a parent."

 For some personal pick me up: your eyes are absolutely gorgeous... like anyone could just melt looking into them even with the pain behind them. Your facial structure is amazing, that jawline alone *muah* but with those cheekbones together is empire takeover levels of beauty! Your  pink sculpted lips are completely kissable and alluring! 

 Keep trying, you are too sweet, too sincere, and too cute to give up!       XOXOXO"
0,callheraddie,1601698513,"Take it one day at a time. Figure out what absolutely needs to happen today and what can wait a day. Then of the things that absolutely have to happen today, can you break them into smaller more manageable tasks? For example, reviewing one chapter or making one call to the pharmacy. Celebrate the small wins and lean on those around you when everything feels too overwhelming. At the end of the day, moving and even school can wait and will always be an option to come back to when you’re ready. Your health, mental and physical, comes first and is most important."

0,nothingtonote,1601695166,"I know firsthand that Bipolar is a roller coaster. The highs are otherworldly and freeing, while the lows are suffocatingly tight gripped. I’m sorry that yours is taking it’s time right now. I can imagine that you’re feeling, rightfully, frustrated. But you’ve been in this sticky muck of a depressive episode before and you’ve managed to kick *its* ass each time! This opponent in particular just needs a few extra hits to exhaust itself. 

Keep reminding yourself that this will pass, because it will. Keep radiating that cheerful smile of yours to other people you will encounter because they will usually send you one right back. Hell, even keep wearing those bright, beautiful glasses because they’re a reminder of how colourful the world can be when the murky cloud tries to make you think otherwise!

I like to think of my extended lows as a visitor who stays too long but will eventually realise that it is no longer welcome. Yours is just finishing its second cup of tea right now, but it’ll piss off soon. Stay safe and keep doing what it is that makes you feel as best as you can. ❤️"

0,emifyre,1601682654,"In 2010 I was very manic, reckless and completely indifferent about whether I lived or died. The miles of corn and soy bean fields that make up all of Illinois outside of Chicago, while open and expansive, felt very suffocating. I had just been cheated on with a boy (we are both lesbians) thus ending a 5 year long relationship that my college self thought was forever.  I didnt realize how abusive and manipulative she was to me until very recently when I went back to Chicago to visit friends. At the time people would tell me things and ask why I let her treat me like that, which I of course brushed away. 

Within one week I decided I needed to leave ASAP if I wanted to stay alive. I was SUPER into Death Cab for Cutie, so Seattle seemed like as good of a place as any. Their music touched me on a deep level and I knew I needed to be a part of that scene. I gave away everything I owned save for what I could fit in a backpack and suitcase, bought a train ticket to Seattle, and was staying in a hostel by the end of the week. I stayed there for two weeks before I realized how expensive housing is here. I had to move back to Chicago to stay with a friend. To be honest, I was planning to go to San Fran to jump off the bridge, but ai met a girl on OKcupid who lived in a subirb of Seattle. A couple of weeks and another train ride later I was living with her. We dated for three years before she cheated on me (notice a pattern yet?). By then though I had established myself in a solid job, which allowed me to stay in the apartment we shared.

That first train ride was terrifying and exciting at the same time. I didnt have much money so I didnt eat for two days until a kind stranger from Spokane slipped $100 and a note into my hoodie pocket while I was sleeping. He didn't ask anything in return, just that I take care of myself and call him if I needed anything at all. It was the kindest thing anyone had ever done for me. 

Fast forward a decade and I'm living in Seattle in a great apartment with my soon to be wife, our doggo, and both of our cats. I have a full time job (a difficult thing when youre bipolar) in a microbiology lab that I love because it keeps me interested and engaged. I started teaching myself guitar and piano recently and even recorded a few songs that I wrote. I am mostly done with the first draft of my newest manuscript and I could not be happier. 

I am telling you this to prove that it is possible to start over in a new city with no one you know and be successful. There were days where I was very nearly homeless and felt like giving up and moving back to Florida or TN to stay with my abusive family, but I didnt. You dont always have to stay positive, but you do have to keep going no matter what because you know that it's better than the alternative. For me it was make this work or kill myself, but it doesn't have to be that dramatic for you.

You are young and gorgeous and have a wonderful attitude. You can do this friend. I know you can because I'm useless and I made it work. Some days you will question whether you made the right decision and convince yourself you should go back. Don't listen to that voice. Just keep going because its better than the alternative. I am proof that you can make friends, find a partner, find a great job, etc. Just don't give up!"
0,m00nscales_,1601682536,"Heyo. You’re beautiful. I obviously don’t know you personally, but I also have BPD and have been where you are.

It’s a hard diagnosis that affects every part of your life as a result of things that weren’t within your control as a child. But one thing that I know is that there are a lot of people with the same diagnosis that love fiercely. Regardless of what the internet says we can overcome our personality malformations and be the best sort of love for others. I sincerely believe that. You will get through this, I can relate to how broken and worthless you might feel but please remember that all the love you have to give someone else you also deserve to direct at yourself.

You will find the right person, and in someways it can be a blessing to feel things so deeply as long as you learn from situations and your own mistakes.

Today might suck but there will be so many good days in your future, beautiful."

0,ExplosiveMufin,1601673054,"Sir, let me tell you, I was a CS major freshman year in 2015 and I was taking the 2nd Java programming class, calc 2, ECE weed out course, and an English class. 
Over time the programming assignments for that java class became so difficult I had essentially formed a group of 10 people to work together in one of the lab rooms to work on the programs. Some of the friends I made in this group are genuinely very smart people. One did 10 APs from highschool, another got an A in calc2 and skipped every class.

200 students entered as CS majors freshman year, 20 graduated senior year. My group of 10? We all switched to IT. The CS advisor told me my grades didn’t reflect the type of student to switch from CS to IT b/c I had gotten like a B in that 2nd Java class (from cheating in a 10 man team). 

I guess all I’m saying is that it’s tough bro and you shouldn’t beat yourself up. It does vary drastically from school to school though. You have my respect if you stick with it. Moreover, I graduated with my IT degree 3.0 gpa, i did a legit software internship for 2 years during school, and got $66k starting elsewhere. It’ll all work out dude I had severe depression during that Java 2 class and it still lingers to this day. One of the other 10 in my group also attempted suicide the following semester. We encouraged him through therapy and he’s still a great friend and is doing better(he also makes more than me! Haha).

I’m convinced the school I went to, University of New Hampshire, had a weak ass CS program and learning how to program in shitty software like fucking Dr. Java ruined it and made learning 10x harder

Also, Calc 2 wasn’t needed for IT, so all the effort I put into it was pointless and I got a D+ in the end. My dad was disappointed in my D+. I tried so hard that semester with everything going on I told him Fuck you lmao. Just try your best and it is what it is. If I didn’t try my best I would probably still be beating myself up to this day, but I’m not! :D

Sorry for the life story or if this wasn’t very toasty but I’m rooting for you my man I full feel you"

After posting my original post here I received an overwhelming amount of support. More than 50 random strangers took the time to tell me that it’s going to be okay and to keep going. 

Reading through those comments made me realize something. Ten years from now, when I’m tucking my children in to bed, turning all the lights off in the house, kissing my wife goodnight, and rolling over to go to sleep....They aren’t going to know what it took to get there. They won’t know about the nights I went to sleep with a stomach full of opiates, not sure if I would wake up the next morning. They won’t know about driving around with a glove box full of syringes and needles. They won’t know about my skinned knees from praying on the gravel in church parking lots at 2am. They won’t know about staring at jet-black vomit in the toilet because you drank an entire bottle of gin just to feel something. They won’t know about the nights I spent with a razor in my hand staring at my wrist. They won’t know about the hours spent in AA and NA meetings trying to put my life back together. They won’t know about spending every penny to my name and going broke to start a business. They won’t know about losing 40lbs in three months because you only have enough money to get half the calories you need for the day. They won’t know about the nights when I cried out for help and the only person who picked up the phone was my dealer. They won’t know about having to cut deals with every professor because you’re failing every class. They won’t know about wearing someone’s sweatshirt because that’s the only thing you have left of them. They won’t know about hours spent in a therapists chair trying to come to terms with my mental illnesses. They won’t know about every joint in my body cracking and popping when I sit down because working out to the point of throwing up is the only coping method that has any sort of results. They won’t know about any of that. They won’t know about simply having to accept that you can’t go through the day without having to cry alone at least once. They won’t know any of that.

The trials you've endured, the tests that made you feel weak or unloved, they will be your strength. Your wounds, your scars, they are proof that you will not be held down.

0,nobunseedsplease,1601646841,"Hi, I thought I’d send this through here with the thought that you may notice it better if it’s not getting lost in the sea of responses on your post. :) 

Moving out is one of the biggest parts; putting space between yourself, abuser and family is crucial to finding some semblance of calm, to rebuild. And look! You’ve already done that! Woot woot! 😃
2nd thing— if you haven’t already, you need to come to terms with/make peace with your past. Forgive yourself. Don’t let anyone that isn’t ready to let go and move on say otherwise. That’s their power over you, *of course* they want you to still feel bad! If you take away what they use to make you feel bad, they lose. :)
I (30/m) have dealt with depression for roughly the past 8 years, and while it has gotten easier to deal with, it’s only because I forgave myself and blocked out everything else. People change, they grow. Tastes change. Hindsight is always 20/20 but being able to look ahead and make new decisions with a clear mind, something you’ll develop while in your own place, is right around the corner!
...
Promise me something? 

Please don’t self-harm, you’re a smart, beautiful, strong woman and mental scars are enough to deal with; don’t take anything out on yourself, you’re not the victim.

You’ve done an insanely brave and challenging thing, and on top of that, your place looks awesome!"
0,ekiechi,1601646812,"I went through. Something very similar in the past. My family is as close to literal demons as it gets. But, I can say this with clarity.

That first moment can be overwhelming, but as time goes you’ll recognize how much better life is unshackled from the past. Keep your eyes forward, and you’ll be fine love. And if that doesn’t cheer you up, you’re also really pretty ☺️"

0,nartimus,1601631154,"You've taken a very brave, positive step for yourself! Moving to a new city can be scary and overwhelming, but also exciting and invigorating! You have a fresh start. An opportunity to reinvent yourself without any expectations. 

Think about how you want your life to look like 5 years from now. Who do you want to be? I would focus on things in your control (what kind of person you want to be, what skills/knowledgebase you want to have, what experiences you'd like as memories, etc.) and everyday take small steps towards those goals. There is a reddit famous comment about having ""non-zero days."" Basically never letting a day go by without doing something, big or small, to move you closer to who you want to be.

You freed yourself from a horrible, abusive cage. Now is your time spread your wings and find your true self."

And hey, if your apartment/landlord allows it, get a cat or some type of animal companion so you feel less lonely. You made the right decision for yourself and it will pay off. 

Not only that, you’re so pretty, jfc. Like it’s so unfair how attractive you are. If I wasn’t gay, I would be sliding in your DM’s trying to get a date with you. But hey, if you’re down to be internet friends, I’m all for it."

You’re a worthy wonderful person regardless of whatever anyone says. Highschool isn’t really fun at all and you have to overcome a lot of social issues.

Doesn’t matter how deep you feel you’ve fallen, how hard you’ve been hit, or how slow you’re making progress—none of that matters. What matters is that you are gonna beat it. I don’t even know you, but I know that. YOU. CAN. WIN.

Bro, you’re an inspiration, and I’m serious when I say that. Seeing your post, I immediately thought “wow, that’s a guy who doesn’t give up.” I’ve never even met you, but you’ve inspired me to try harder myself.

Sometimes the steps you take to get where you want to be aren’t glamorous or easy, but you’re doing it, and you should be proud of that! Good luck, and I hope you can be as proud of yourself as a random internet stranger is proud of you!"

0,caionow,1601618717,"You chat shit.

You posted in r/weed

Been smoking since March, but my partner always rolled the blunts for us.

You posted in r/relationship advice

So I am in a similar situation. The guy I’m seeing didn’t tell me he was seeing other people,

My toast to you is you have nice handwriting. Please don't lie for attention."
0,OnTheSubjectOfWeird,1601617996,"Isaiah. I put it to our other moderators.

The post that we have here does not comply with the community rules eg Verification (no note, and Self Promotion.
Regarding the latter we like to have people celebrate work they do but when it results in direct publicity (advertising) and potential profit, then we would would be concerned where to draw the line and consider whether we would be endorsing or even taking part in creating a product (if there were one).


In the case of your app, it is open to In App purchases which would solely go to benefit you. As we had no input we wouldn't have a say in that but equally using the image of the glasses here, similar to our own could confuse someone again to say ""well surely r/Toastme are behind this."" the next concern from that is what if there were impropriety or complaints about your product/service. We cannot be put receiving complaints about this or trying to deal with fallout from a product.


We recently had a case where images were taken from the site with people's verification and used to advertise a Toast Me CBD oil business. Obviously we didn't condone it as they were using other people's pictures for their own gain but also considering the legalities of CBD oil at the time. Those individuals were contacted and approached the company who fortunately saw sense in removing the images but it demonstrates issues of people using the Sub's name.


TL;DR after being burned by other promotions and products, and considering that the app is completely independent of us and may make you a profit/gener, we cannot promote it on our site. While we wish you well, we will be issuing an addition to our Community Info saying that we do not endorse any product or service using Toastme as a service."

0,ct21rocket,1601612361,Sorry for the things that you’re having to go through. But it doesn’t look like you’re trying to smile. You are smiling. know that you can bounce back from the adversity.

Maintain your positivity and that peak will show up. Best of luck to you.

Give yourself that chance. Give yourself a shot. You are worth it. I love you
0,unicornsong19,1601610497,"Edit: Some have noticed in a past post I mentioned a partner, so a quick explanation. Believe me or not, it doesn’t quite matter. My friend and I are not in a relationship. He is essentially my FWB and due to extenuating life circumstances, he also lives with me. He moved in with me when COVID started and we quarantined together. He has always drawn a line and neither of us has crossed it. Being in a relationship with him would be complicated for both of us, so I’m enjoying the situation for what it is. I say partner bc it’s easier than “FWB who is also my roommate who is also one of my best friends.”

It still stands that I’ve never had a boyfriend. I’ve never been on a date. I’ve never had anyone confess feelings for me, only physical attraction. I was feeling down about that, and came here to be cheered up. 99% of the comments have been extremely helpful for me, so I deeply appreciate that. Thank you all!!! ♥️♥️♥️"

The situation genuinely doesn’t bother me—I enjoy having him around, and at the end of the day, he’s my friend before anything else. If I’d had a boyfriend before him, I don’t think this would even remotely be an issue for me. It’s less that I want to be in a relationship with him specifically, and more why doesn’t HE want to be in a relationship with me?

0,BoogerRuth,1601607721,"You're emotionally intelligent and you care for other people. The world needs people like you more than ever.

You have beautiful eyes. I know that means piss all, but you should hear it every day.

If you can't love yourself right now find someone else to live for until you can.

Live for your little sister, live for your goldfish, live because you once made a really killer doodle in seventh grade.

While you're staying alive for them, make friends with yourself. You're worth knowing if you'll open up. It's a long road and you'll never like all the bits of yourself, but if you shine a light around you'll find plenty to love.

If you need someone to talk to, or to just listen, reach out. I'm happy to chat or just sit quietly while you vent."

Please don't give up! Also, it's okay to feel sad, or angry, or hurt, or any other emotion; this makes us human. Acknowledge how you're feeling, take a deep breath, and find something positive. I recommend growing something simple from a seed, or adopting an animal. Knowing that something relies on me to keep moving helps me to actually keep moving.

So stay, i only ask this. live for you and your loved ones, your hopes and dreams, every single one in this subreddit. We love and support you, bro.

0,Noose84,1601598760,"Great observation, Mason. You’re on to something, I think. 

You’re doing the right thing. Reaching out for help, even to strangers, is absolutely the right thing to do. That’s part of a survival instinct you have so trust it. There’s no rule that says you have to go through life and all it’s rough patches alone. In fact, you’re not supposed to. Seek the company and counsel of others as much to dissipate your frustrations as to learn how to overcome them. We all do it to get through tough times. Recognizing that you’re in one is the first step, getting some help the next, and then grinding it out until you get through is the next after that. You’re two thirds there. Good for you. You’ve got this. We know you can do it and believe in you. Good luck."
0,longmason1,1601598753,"Well so first things first, i think it's worth celebrating you having your daughter. I grew up without ever meeting my dad, and I know an awful lot of people who are the same. Some of us stretch the truth and say it didnt effect us growing up but of course it did. some less than others but still. I think it's incredibly admirable that you put the onus on yourself to take care of your daughter. It's easy to run and not look back but you didn't.  


Secondly, I wanna kinda just say that you arnt alone in feeling unenthusiastic; to share a little bit about my own relation to this I've found much earlier this year that I've stopped enjoying the things I used to enjoy, and it took a really long time for me to figure out what was going on and to be honest im not even confident that I have. For me i feel like I can't enjoy things because I expect the worst of every situation. Even if things don't go wrong, I'm prepared for when they do. I've convinced myself that it's when, not if things go wrong and it's preventing me from loving the things I love. You take that and you stack on top of it general social issues people might be having, confidence issues that are taking over seemingly everyone, job stress, overall life concerns and it's a perfect recipe to just go numb because it's easier to deal with the bullshit that way. I know that may not be 1:1 with how your feeling but I just wanted you to know you're not alone in feeling this way  


Thirdly - I wish I could tell you how to 'fix' things but honestly I don't know. All I can offer is an ear if you need to speak a truth or just get something off your chest; my inbox is open and I promise to not give unsolicited advice, judgement, or prescribe any solutions - I'll just listen. I hope you find what you need to secure happiness again. You deserve it"

But you did my dude and I think that alone deserves some love. You've got a fighting spirit, if you didn't you wouldn't have posted. To me, albeit a random person on the internet, you taking this step and fighting tooth and nail NOT to give up is incredibly inspirational.

Those of us with BPD have a tendency to emotionally attach ourselves to another person and feel a deep sense of connection to them.

My words are definitely not a new concept, and I don’t take credit for them as some epiphany that no one had ever thought of before.  But it’s how I view relationships, and it definitely helped me through a hard time in my life.  Some of us self-hate and find blame in ourselves when relationships fail.  Stepping back and seeing a bigger picture can help us work through that and heal.  Isn’t that the goal?  To heal and learn and do better next time?

Still, I don't understand how someone can throw someone away like that, especially someone like you. As cynical as it sounds, there is a part of me that says that you can't give them your everything too quickly, you have to make sure they will respect the fragile parts of you.

Also did you know that 5’11” is actually above average height and at 18 most people haven’t completely stopped growing so if you think you’re short, you’re not.

The next 10 years will hold similar growth, similar triumphs, and similar celebrations.  Take your experience up to this point, really focusing on those things that bring you joy, and seek those things out - you’ll be glowing when you’re 40, with another 10 years of joy and experience under your belt.

I have a senior with no clue as to what he wants to do after graduation. He's handsome, like you, but pretty short, so he looks young too. Lonely and depressed fits so many of us right now, that's completely normal.

I know it’s hard, and maybe now isn’t the best time for you personally to date (or maybe it is, I don’t know you personally) but nonetheless, it’s important to keep in mind that you deserve to be treated right. If I were you, and in this situation, I kinda am, I’d make a list of things that you require in a partner.

You're absolutely not alone in that. I hope you are back to healthy soon. Seeing people struggle with breathing difficulties due to covid has given me new respect for people with asthma or chronic breathing difficulties. Perhaps increased compassion will be your silver lining. Take care!"
0,SterryDan,1601572610,Yeah I couldve worded it better. Also I have BPD. I never said shut it off. I said i dont make relationships like that for the same reason as op. And i told them it was bc of therapy. I guess im kinda numb to it bc ive had this done to me before. But ive also been a “fp” and if someone with bpd isnt self aware it can be tolling. I cant say what happened with op but its obviously a repeat occasion thats going to hurt them every time. Its sadly the truth and I just know what its like to be in that cycle.
0,uhrilahja,1601572565,"Ohh, that sounds amazing! No wonder you chose to move!

You're healing, and no one who's healing should ever have to feel like they're not strong enough just because it's a process without instantaneous results. You're going to get through this.

I can't speak to the BPD but from an outside perspective, neurotypical people don't often stay around those who 'give them their everything.' You should try to focus on yourself and make sure you get more attention than anyone around you. Maybe you can manage it in a small way and eventually build better habits. 

Good luck!"

Here's an awkward internet hug from some rando. I do not have bpd, so I'm not going to pretend like I know what you're feeling. All I'll say is that you have a lot of people you don't know who GENUINELY care about your well-being."
0,nightadventurer,1601570825,"I really like your style. I think that means you work on yourself a lot. So I don't think it's necessarily that you're doing something wrong. I feel like that a lot too.

More often that not, I find that I don't focus energy on the people in my life that treat me positively through easy and hard times. So I think it's important to go back to the beginning of that relationship and look at what attracted you to them in the first place. It is up to us to break the cycle - to teach others how we want to be treated. Lately, I've been able to recognize now when someone isn't a good fit for me and I gently let them know that I am very busy now. ;)

Don't ever let anyone puff you up with the same trite shit like you're beautiful and unique, cuz while you may be physically attractive none of that will matter in the long run. Beauty fades, but crazy lasts forever. We just learn to swim, or sink into the abyss. Sucks but true."

0,evil_mike,1601567863,"&gt;and I know it wouldn’t be the same for him

Hey friend. First, re-read what you wrote and ask yourself if that's the kind of relationship you deserve (hint: it isn't). Without even knowing you, I can tell you that you, like all of us, deserve relationships where the give-and-take is equal. That's what a REAL partnership is! Don't settle for less than that (my unsolicited advice for the day). It also sounds like the dude is taking a scorched earth approach to ending the relationship. Once you are a bit further away from the event horizon, you'll probably find that you're extremely grateful you don't have someone with such toxic tendencies in your life. It's hard to see that now, because the breakup just happened...trust me, you're better off.  


Okay, now that I've said my part, stop what you're doing and go read /u/BaconNCaffeine's reply to your post. Then read it again. This is the best thing I've read on Reddit in a long time, and something we should all take to heart.

Sit with your emotions as best you can for the next three days, no matter how uncomfortable they get, and then take a deep breath and start to work on letting them go. It’s a long process, and takes a while especially when you feel like you’re owed closure from them. There will be good days and bad days. This is the time to turn yourself into your own favourite person, bake some Halloween cookies, light your favourite candles, take a bath or hot shower with your favourite bath products.

You’re last line “i keep giving them my everything for them to leave me like I was nothing. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong” is really interesting though. Especially as someone with bpd it can be really helpful to have a therapist as an outside perspective that can help you get an understanding of unhealthy patterns and ways to recognize them. If you have insurance speaking to someone about your relationship patterns may really help you break this cycle.

Best of luck in the future babes.

Edit: btw ootl what’s fp? I understood it to mean partner of some kind, is that correct?"
0,BaconNCaffeine,1601562657,"I cried when I realized this truth in my life.  I was married to a man who simply didn’t love me anymore.  It broke me for a while, but there is a massive amount of relief for us when we finally accept that we didn’t DO anything wrong!  We didn’t fail, and we ARE good enough.  And anyone who tells us or makes us feel otherwise is absolutely not right for us!

I bawled like a baby when I finally let go of feeling like I was somehow at fault for my marriage failing.  It was so relieving for my soul to know that I didn’t have to feel bad about the end.  I could breathe again.  And I cried.  

PS: crying is an amazing way to let go.  Think of it as all the bad feelings being washed clean.  It’s good to have emotions and to feel.  It’s human.  And crying with relief and joy is just as helpful as sobbing in pain.  It lets us know that our feelings are getting too big (good or bad) and we need to let them out.  

Hopefully those are relieved tears.  *hug*"

It sucks that people just don’t expect it too show, and in this case, leave someone who genuinely cared about them.

0,BaconNCaffeine,1601556228,"I popped in to tell you:
Puzzle pieces don’t always fit.  We look for the ones who go together.  When they have similar colors and edges, we often even try to make them fit.  Sometimes they’ll go together for a bit, but as we move on with the puzzle and we see how nicely other pieces click together, we realize that those two...they aren’t quite right.  And it’s more frustrating because when they’re similar, we WANT them to fit!  When they don’t match at all, it’s easy to see that they don’t go together...not true when they’re very alike.

But here’s the thing.  Neither puzzle piece is broken for not fitting.  Neither piece is ‘less than’ any other piece because it didn’t go with a piece that wasn’t it’s match to begin with!!!!  It’s frustrating, and when our heart is involved...it can hurt like hell.  But don’t lose sight of the fact that your piece is there.  And sometimes you have to try some wrong ones.  If we made the mistake of leaving those two pieces together, we’d end up with a puzzle that we could never finish!

As a mom, I wish I could give you a hug and tell you that you’re perfect just the way you are.  You didn’t fail and you’re not doing anything wrong babe. It just wasn’t your piece.  You are beautiful, unique, perfect, and valuable just the way you are.  In fact, without YOU, we could never have a complete puzzle.

I know it’s hard.  I know it hurts.  Try to learn about yourself and what didn’t work so you can see the flags in a relationship in the future.  Be gentle on yourself and let yourself heal.  Get yourself strong so when the next puzzle piece comes along, you can try again.  Enjoy the journey of trying different pieces.  It makes you better at seeing what works and what doesn’t.  And you WILL be ok."

i'm sorry for what happend, but trust me, things will get better, and you will find the perfect one for you :)"
0,OtterboiGamer,1601553602,"I didn't know what fp meant so I looked it up, I can't even imagine how terrible that must be to lose, my deepest sympathies. No matter how bad things get and seem, there's always a silver lining I believe. Sometimes it takes a while to be evident, but I truly believe there's a positivity that stems from every bad thing. Just have to stay strong and endure until it shows :) losing any person you trusted as a confidant/friend is super tough (been there a few) but things always have a way of working out in the end. Just got to always look towards the future and the hope and happiness it brings.

On a much lighter note, your hair is absolutely KILLER! I love it, and your eyeliner is great too! Legit would be your friend in a heartbeat based just on that (random, yes, but I'm a random kind of dude lol)."

0,Skyvolta,1601553266,"There's nothing wrong with you. You're beautiful and everything you do is how you do things and it's your own way. (It's really early in the morning... I'm tired) Someday somewhere someplace, may be far away, you'll be able to shed a smile instead of a tear and with someone that you won't need to put everything in. It's a big small world out there. Be patient and be persistent and things will work out 😊"

0,reddeaddaytrader,1601552768,"Hey, love. You're gorgeous, and from being there myself (bpd can go fuck itself), that counts on the inside. We all seem to have our things in common and, I know people find an excuse to use us and call US the badguys but..   
Screw that. Just means you feel more strongly. I think that's beautiful.   
On the account of your fp.. I'm sorry they're an asshole. That's not on you. Yeah? It's hard not to take that hard, and I know that. But everytime you get a chance, remind yourself in the mirror, that's not on you, until it no longer hurts. Til a better fp comes along. I know technically thats not the best advice, but it may be advice that can help until ya can take whatever the best advice may be.   


Keep your head up, love. You'll find the people worthy of your love someday sooner than you imagine, yeah? I keep telling myself the same, and I know eventually I'll see that pay off. You will, too."

The pain and anguish you're going through might feel unbearable right now but I promise you it will get better and you come out stronger than ever.

These tough times will pass, and you’re gonna be alright. You’re gonna be alright, just like all the other times it felt like you weren’t gonna be alright, but you ended up making it through. I have faith in you!  All of us do. Let the mother figure you lost to this awful pandemic be what fuels you. Let her spirit flow through how you interact people and love people and talk to people! The best part of loving someone is always having a piece of them with you. Even when they’re gone. So let her shine through you. All the love man. I hope you feel better soon."

I'm so glad that you ended up being alright, I've been there with the covid scare and it truly is scary when you aren't sure. For words of encouragement, here are some things that bring me peace in hard times:

- At any given moment are always doing the best that we can do, and we can always do better, try harder, and be more motivated to change. This doesn't mean that you need to tire yourself out trying to be better, it means that even if you feel like you can't do a lot in this moment, you are capable of growth and healing! You won't always feel how you feel right now!

- ""When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.” -Fred Rogers

- ""Knowing that we can be loved exactly as we are gives us all the best opportunity for growing into the healthiest of people."" 
-Also Fred Rogers (You can be and I guarantee are loved exactly as you are in this moment. Don't you dare forget that!)"

0,aaronnnnnnnnn,1601532332,"You look like such an interesting and friendly person, and I love your eyeshadow! If I saw you on the street I'd want to be your friend! Also I feel you with the weight thing, I think the stress and staying inside has caused many many many people to gain weight (including me hehehe 😅). Our bodies fluctuate  so much within our lifetimes, and it's good to give our bodies the space to do that. Your body is so strong and and smart and resilient that it realized you were having a hard time and it helped you by storing more energy for you! And when you don't need that extra energy your body will most likely fluctuate again! It's okay to gain weight. I know it's hard though and I feel for you. Be kind to yourself though, don't stress too much about that stuff until you're in a better place. I hope you find tenderness and love for yourself in these trying times 💚"

Sometimes i think about our human ancestors having “bad days”  and I laugh at my bad day: ice ages, sabertooth cats, tribal wars, malaria, no food, comets, droughts, etc. 10,000 generations hung in so you could be you. Just hang in like they did and shit will get better."
0,aaronnnnnnnnn,1601531553,"I hope this isn't weird to say but you look like such a friendly and kind person. You've been through a lot, so if sometimes you cant be as strong as you want to be it's okay. You're allowed to feel scared or sad and just because you feel bad mentally in that moment doesn't mean you'll feel that way forever, give yourself the love and space to heal without rushing it. Don't make yourself stay strong all of the time just because you might feel like you have to. It tires you out and makes you feel angry when you can't live up to the unrealistic expectations you have for yourself.One of my favorite mantras is ""At any given moment we are doing the best that we can"". Even if your 100% is 30% of your 100% when you're feeling good, you're still giving your 100% in that moment and you should be proud of yourself. I'm so proud of you for existing and reaching out to others even though things are terrible, and I hope you are able to find peace and love and tenderness for yourself right now. I also hope someone gives you a big hug (if you like hugs, if not then something else that's comforting to you). 💚💚💚"

I think it's amazing that you are pushing forward. Getting up. Finding a meaning in this time is so difficult. Let alone doing it after the losses you have experienced. This is an absolute horrific time. You are wonderful, you have worth, and your self-awareness of your feelings is incredible. Keep waking up every morning. Or day or even night. Keep getting up, getting dressed and living one more day, because that takes amazing strength in itself. You got this! Push forward and time will pass with it and soon you'll be further down the road and you can look back and be proud of how far you've made it."
0,Venomous_Kobra,1601526300,"hey guys, i'm sorry i couldn't responded to every single one of you i'm just overwhelmed by the support you all have given me! WOW!! 

Honestly, this year has no doubt been the most difficult i have ever dealt with in my life. Not only did i got laid off from my favorite job due to this, but i also lost other friends due to the protest (long story), a lot of my favorite cons got cancelled (including one that was supposed to be on my birthday in December) and my brother &amp; father contacted covid but also recovered thankfully. My mom's a nurse and seeing her go through so much, such as me, is hard, but as you guys say, i am gonna remind strong and get through this day by day. I have been exercising and taking vitamins to help my immune system, it's been a journey but i'm happy to still be here.  :)

0,Coldee53,1601520100,"I’m not sure if this is what you want to hear, so I’m sorry if this seems too blunt. But I believe the deep truth is that suffering actually makes you into a stronger person in the end. When the world shifts beneath your feet, you shift your stance and adjust. That was a huge lesson / analogy for me from Oprah, which I read when I thought my two-year-old daughter was going to die in a major heart surgery where they had to rearrange her heart, and I had to be strong. I know everything probably feels dismal, but you need to give yourself time to grieve and also recognize and accept that life is not fair (main theme from a great book by Scott Peck “the road less traveled”). Right now you need to find strength more than anything.  The fact that you are reaching out here on Reddit tells me that you are choosing the path of healing. I hope you are gentle and patient with yourself.  Be proud that you are a good person to have friends and close family, and that you are a survivor."

0,karenrn64,1601518381,"First of all, you are more than a number on the scale. That number can and does change. Anyone who judges you based on how much you weigh is missing your true value. Some of us have enjoyed the isolation but the majority of people have had a hard time with it. Realize that this virus has been a game changer for most of the world. I mean, not that long ago if you went into a business wearing a mask you would have been viewed as either a robber or a terrorist. Now wearing a mask around others is the new norm. Hopefully you have a therapist to help you with the depression and anxiety. Please continue to get dressed nicely, including the makeup, because you are a beautiful young woman and even if it’s only one day a week it’s nice to remind yourself of how nice you look."

And you might think that's not exactly a positive thing right now but remember that the grief you carry with you is the representation of the love and friendship those beautiful people gave to you.

You feel because you are alive, you feel because you have lived and were brave enough to love.

That grief is a gift. It's just disguised as pain right now. It will make your a fuller and more loving and open person if you let it.

So stick with it. One day at a time. Keep your heart open and feel it (whatever ""it"" is) and be grateful that you get the privlage to feel something so strong.

❤️"

0,TacoRockapella,1601505710,"You are very strong. You have been through a lot this year. I think it’s brave of you to make this post. It’s okay to say that we’re feeling this year. We don’t have to always put on a brave face and act tough. 

I don’t know you but the second I saw your photo I thought to myself this guy is a cool dude. You seem like a great person and I hope some love and kindness finds it way into your life."
0,mdanao,1601505062,"I’m so sorry to hear about all of your losses. You are a strong person mentally, just for sharing that news on the internet. Keep your head up and try to tell yourself three positive things everyday. Or when you’re feeling angry or down. It helped me get out of a dark place. I know nothing can break back those you loved dearly, I’ve been there too with loss after loss. Just know they’re all looking out for you now and will be proud of you, with anything you accomplish in your life."

We’ve been together 2 years and have a puppy and a joint savings for a house, and suddenly she’s been spending all her time with her friends and doesn’t seem interested in me. I went home yesterday and last night I asked if she wanted to breakup and she said she doesn’t know. 

It’s been an awful awful week and I feel like just laying down with my thoughts all day. I’ve tried playing PlayStation but I just don’t have the energy. All that is keeping me going is my dad"

Know, however, that we're not all the same, so being and looking the best is different for everyone. Regardless of that, you seem like you have what it takes to achieve all of that. Plus, you are a handsome and attractive young man and being accepted to a law school alone already tells me a lot about your potential.

Secondly, there is nothing, and I say absolutely nothing unattractive about you. You have a beautifully shaped face, very attentive, kind eyes, a proportionate nose, and small, but plump rosy lips.

So many people are working through serious pain right now, so please don't feel that it's only you. You are not alone, and you are going to make it. This year will just be a part of your incredible story.

In the meantime, make sure you're getting all of your strength and immune system-building vitamins. Drink tons of water. Get some fresh air if you can. Move as much as is comfortable for you. Exercise is a game changer when it comes to mental health. I also (slowly) recovered from Covid, and I've learned that health is the absolute greatest gift.

I have on acquaintance that taught middle school and she got punched in the face three times in a year. Come to think about it zoom classes don't seem so bad now. Let's face it, work sucks at the best of times, and these are not the best of times.

Also as someone who has crossed the veil and has entered the dreaded thirties a few years back, it ain't so bad. You'll still meet new people and basically do mostly the same things you do in your twenties, it's just the price for irresponsibility gets a bit higher (like it takes a week to recover from staying up all night). You look great and that's not changing any time soon.

I'm halfway into a PhD right now, I distinctly remember the first day of class in grad school and the feeling of panic ""that I didn't belong there""  and I was a fraud and I was going to be found out. Lucky for me I looked around and it was clear that everyone felt the same way. One time I walked out to go to the bathroom and on my way back saw one of my classmates just crying because she felt so overwhelmed, we actually became really good friends afterwards.

0,AtomicRainSpike,1601474819,"I feel you. These are tough times. What I try to do is make important mental health habits a sort of ritual. I'm in bed early. I take my sleep meds and watch soothing videos to get me to sleep at 8:30pm. I wake up and workout. I do 100 pull-ups and 100 kettlebell swings. I eat high protein, low sugar meals and stop eating after 6 pm. At 2pm, I take a hot bath with all the lights out and meditate for 30 minutes. It's helped me tremendously. Take care of yourself bro! I hope you become everything you've ever imagined!🍷🍸🍹🥃🍻🥂"

0,Addramyrz,1601457541,"My deepest sympathy. Seriously. My deepest sympathy. I have been in the same situation more time than I can count.  I spent most of this January outside in the snow bawling myself to sleep; dealing with the fact that I was a failure as a husband and felt completely unwelcomed in my own home.   It took a good amount of time to pick myself up and regain my self-respect.  I'm not ashamed to admit my lowest point...now.

Looking back, it seems pathetic that I would sit outside my own house sobbing. Constantly looking down the alley for the familiar sound of my real wife, my real owner, the one who would never, ever treat me so bad...  Only to come to the conclusion that who ever lived in my house now... Did not care for me anything like the person who use to treat me as a family member.   This was not who I committed my life to anymore."

The love your give your students WILL give you all the encouragement and strength you need. A day after the break up I went into work and put on my “brave face” for my kids. It was a testing day, so once they were done with their test they could read, draw, work on something for another class, etc. One of my kiddos (who has been through some very tough times on their own) started drawing. At the end of class, they came up to me with a drawing of a ballerina (I used to be a pro ballerina) and said “you looked sad so I thought this might cheer you up”. It made my day/week/month. As you become a teacher, don’t take those moments for granted. They will remind you of your importance and your worth as an educator and as a person"

For all the folks talking about having confidence around women.  I call bull shit, you can't fake confidence for long, you have to earn it.  

The only way to earn confidence is to improve yourself for you, not to attract women or impress people.  You do it by doing thing (work, school, hobbies, travel), doing the things you enjoy and are good at, make more friends and enjoy life to the point you don't give a fuck about what people think."

I hope you have some kind of a support system too! And I wish you all the best. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to get really good grades like you did before.

I’m also 20 in college right now and for me I noticed that i did better on essays when I made an outline of what I wanted to write first. It would just be a page or half a page of bullets points of what I want each paragraph to be about. Then, I start writing in whatever section/paragraph I think is the easiest and work my way up to the harder paragraphs. Once I have all the pieces, I put it all together. I hope that’s at least a little bit helpful. Good luck! You’ll do great :)"

If you allow me to say that, the most needed things in life is failure! First because it makes you improve and second because it allow you to really appreciate happiness and good things!  
Take things slowly and always remember the good things happening right now! For example those multiples toasts right here! Some of them are here to comfort you and you should be happy even when it comes from random stranger! So be HAPPY, you're doing and looking GREAT!!

There’s been a lot of great suggestions about finishing your assignment, liking breaking it up into small chunks. I just graduated university and didn’t ask for support from professors until my final semester, despite struggling with mental health throughout my degree and I’m kicking myself for not doing it sooner.

If you can work up the courage to send a genuine email (you can be vague and say “struggling with mental health”), it might help you get an extension. 

Either way, I believe you can do this! You’re stronger than you think, happiness is around the corner."

0,chaoticgoodnss,1601398452,"Hi there!

I am sorry to hear about what you are going through. I relate to your struggles. I noticed that after purging, sometimes I have inflammation or bloating- this can make someone who already struggles with body image feel worse. If you have access to it, I recommend green tea with ginger, as that can help not only with the inflammation, but can also help sooth your throat from the purging. 

As for your headache, have you tried a cold press on your eyes? Sometimes that helps me. Your essay sounds like it’s stressing you, and that’s okay. However, it is unhealthy to overwork yourself. Sometimes you can’t avoid it; and that is natural. If you can though, I recommend taking 25 minute naps periodically, that way you can give your brain a break and let your mind recharge. This can help your productivity writing your essay! 

Even with all of the stress, the pain, and the bursted blood vessels- you are extremely beautiful. I have faith in you. Just keep fighting, okay? 

乾杯！！"

0,Kuiken81,1601396216,"Your job is a huge chunk of your life, but doesn't define you or your worth as a person! Hurts that you didn't get the position, but hopefully you can use the feedback to improve your performance or maybe find another job that's a better fit! You never know what new opportunities this could bring-I completely changed my career course when I wasn't accepted into a post-graduate school. At the time I was devastated as that school/profession had been my childhood dream. But the new path I pursued opened up SO many doors and has been a blast, I wouldn't change it. Obviously easier to appreciate in hindsight and might not ease your disappointment in the current moment, but trust me-better days are on the way! It's easy to say, but remember you didn't get the higher position ""this time"". The future is wide open with possibility! 

Hopefully you're getting help for your depressive episodes, whether professionally or through friends/family. Take care of yourself and your mental health. Your job performance is not a reflection of your performance as a human being. I don't know you personally, but I know that you tried and got hurt trying; that you care about your job and your performance and want to improve. Caring and personal growth are awesome human traits, so I'd say you're doing pretty good as a person :)"

0,WarProgenitor,1601375952,"Depression is a legitimate illness. Never let anyone make you feel guilty about how you cope and survive valiantly despite it all. Rates of depression have skyrocketed since the pandemic.

Do you best to objectively understand when your brain lies to you, and call it out when it does. Personally, it helped me start laughing at how ridiculous my honest self-image was, and helped me find a more honest interpretation of myself. This is definitely still something I do my best learn about and try to better myself at day by day. It's an endless battle, but more i become more and more equipped at fighting as times passes.

But lastly, you have a very sincere, beautiful and warm smile, no matter the hardships endured behind the eyes. Please never forget that stranger 💜"

0,badlyferret,1601367976,"From what I see, I see a super cute young man. I just gotta call a spade ""a spade"" on that one. It is unfortunate that you're feeling depressed/down. I'm sorry your life seems to be spiraling endlessly but I'm quite sure you're doing your best as everyone is doing their best at any given time when one takes into account each person's natural limitations and abilities. So in the end, you've done your best throughout this past year and that's all anyone can ever ask of you. And even though you could believe your best isn't good enough, some things end just to provide new beginnings. I might suck at being a surgeon which could lead to me losing my house, but maybe I'm better off being a surfer who lives in a renovated van. In my opinion, I think I'd rather be a happy surfer but I've digressed. I don't know your situation any more than what you've described but if I can leave you with one thing it's that nothing in the past is indicative of what will happen in the future. Hang in there. You're doing your best and that's good enough.

So here's to you 🥂. Even though we from time to time fall in the mud, it is only from mud does a lotus grow. No mud, no lotus. I genuinely wish you the best of good fortune."
0,Happy_Fun_Balll,1601367938,"Hey, I just wanted to let you know that, as a person who has, over the last twenty or so years, gained, lost, gained, lost (etc) significant amounts of weight due to a physical issue that, when active, restricts movement, your feelings of unattractiveness are all yours and nobody else’s. I’m sure even when you were bigger you weren’t unattractive, because attraction isn’t all about weight, height, or even totally about outward appearance, but a *lot* of it has to do with the way you carry yourself and is a reflection of your own self-worth. Do not forget that you **are** worthy of love, and that love comes first from inside.

That said, even if we *only* took outward appearance into consideration, you’re not unattractive in the least! Those glasses are absolutely perfect for your face, you’ve got really nice eyes, full lips, and the most symmetrical head I’ve ever seen (I know that sounds weird but seriously that was my first thought was that the shaved head and five o’clock shadow deal you’ve got going on suits your face shape *perfectly.* And even though your look may not be everyone’s cup of tea - because even the most beautiful looking humans aren’t considered so by everyone - you’ve definitely got a look going there that is pretty great. Kind of a ‘90s alt rock icon deal. 

But don’t base your self-worth on your appearance. I’m sure you’ve got a lot of amazing qualities that go beyond the “Is he using a filter or does her really look that good?” look you’re serving. Maybe you do kind things for people without broadcasting it to all of your Instagram/Snapchat followers. Maybe you have a soft spot for animals. Maybe you are amazing at your chosen profession. Whatever your deal(s), *you’ve got this.* And above all, do *not* be afraid to ask for mental health help if you need it. I want you to still be here long after the fresh hell that 2020 keeps dishing out is just a cringey memory."

You come across as honest, and I’m glad you’re reaching out to others and trying to help yourself. The desire to improve oneself is a wonderful quality to have. You also seem in touch with your feelings, another beautiful quality.

You remind me of the type of guy that everyone wants around - dependable, kind, an amazing moral compass. I’ve come to realise in life that depression can be a gift. It seems like it’s striving to strip our spirit away but it’s helping us to grow bigger and better day after day, and guiding us to tap into our inner most feelings. Living with depression is an opportunity to come out the other side more self aware and self loving. I think you’re going to stare it in the face and win... after all who would say no to those eyes?

As I grow older I think acceptance is where I’m at, because I no longer worry about such things.  People have came and gone as happens in life, but I’ve become happy with me trudging along, learning new things, new experiences, and yes meeting new people that might eventually leave my side.  I will say one good thing about Reddit and other online communities is that I will see comments that highlight similar or same experiences as me and that also helps with lightening feelings like this. Again I can only speculate because your feeling of “aloneness” could be different from mine, but what you said stuck me as familiar so I shared my view.  Best of luck"

How to get this hair:

Step 1: grow it for your life til it's buttcrack length.
Step 2: dye it.
Step 3: plait it for 24hrs while its still wet.
Step 4: put it in a bun with 4 to 6 hair ties for several hours.
Step 5: unleash the beast and worry about brushing it later"
0,Coldee53,1601348655,I see so much inner and outer beauty looking at your picture. You are so smart to ask for positive feedback in this crazy time. Please know that in my life (57 yrs) I’ve never seen such craziness as this year.  This is temporary and the future will normalize and be much better as we all work together.  Most people are caring and good.  I’m proud of you for being brave and taking the initiative with reaching out to the health dept. and also here!

I can see the heaviness on your heart in your eyes, but I also feel this warmth that radiates from beneath the surface when I look at you.

I bet there are so many people that you don't even realise you bring greatness to when you enter their sphere. 
You are a light in the world."

I couldn't make it through college even without a pandemic and, well, \*gestures broadly at everything\* so I'm truly impressed at your efforts and what you've accomplished so far. The end is near! What are you studying, if you care to share?

Keep going. &lt;3"

I know just saying that seems a little shallow, maybe, but I promise you I've been where you are. Feeling totally alone and isolated. So many of us have. I'm truly sorry you're going through this especially in this time of distancing. We all deal with these feelings in our own way. The key to that is dealing with it and not just avoiding it. You've taken a great first step with your post here. There are so many avenues to take, find your groove man.

I don’t even know you, but for some reason I feel kinda proud of you. Weird but true. 
You’re building yourself a life and forging something that’s worthwhile for you. Yes, you’re tired. Yes, it’s hard and stressful. But the end result is worth it. I think you know that. 

You’re doing really well. Take it day by day and don’t give up! 😌"

I’ve been there and I’m currently there in grad school. I feel your pain and your exhaustion. What you’re doing is so hard and not enough people acknowledge and understand that. -hug- you can do this. You can finish school and give yourself a fucking break. If nothing else get through this semester. You’re amazing and smart.

And trust me when I say, as someone who also suffers from depression, that living with said depression isn't as impossible as it may sound. Yes it will be difficult. Yes you will struggle. But in the end, I believe in you. We all do.

And on that note, there is one thing that I must recommend. Please, find someone to talk to. It can be a therapist, a friend, or just strangers on the internet like us (be careful with that last one though).
Finding someone to talk to is one of, if not the best thing you can do for yourself right now.

Hope your day goes well! 🤗"
0,MrsAstroMikeDexter,1601336361,"I'm so sorry to hear how bad you're feeling. Maybe you're wondering if anyone can relate or truly understand just how alone you feel... Even though I don't know your story, I'm sure I know that kind of pain because I've been there too. So many people have. Maybe everyone at some point. That's just to say, however you're feeling isn't ""bad"" or ""weird"" or abnormal. It's okay to sit with your loneliness rather than ignoring it or fighting it. It's okay to feel the depth of these painful feelings. And if tomorrow you feel a little less weighted, it's okay to feel that too. If you'll take a book recommendation from a stranger, please get You Are Here. While it's got a Buddhist bend, it's really about mindfulness and accepting these hard things rather than pushing them out of your mind. While you're feeling low, the last thing you want to do is fight yourself. I went through a lot of grieving this summer and that book was a catalyst for me to begin understanding my pain rather than denying it. I know it's a long shot but if you're reading this, wrap your arms around yourself and know people care about you. You're gonna get through this storm sweetheart 💙"

Hang on tight, that feeling of being alone will resorb, I swear to you on my own life. Those steps you're taking right now are bloody hard, and although you think you're taking a smile in that picture, it's clear that there is a strong will to live and be happy in your eyes and in your face.

Life is shit, and does not throw all of us the same balls. Remember that at the end of the day, it is YOUR life, no one else's. Make the choices that will make you happy, and if you don't know what makes you happy yet, that's totally fine! I just turned 30 and it was 7 months ago that I felt genuinely happy for the first time in my life.

And the suicide attempts, the horrible mornings and the nights of anguish all feel so far away now.

There's light at the end of that tunnel, please don't stop walking.

I love you friend. You deserve to be here and if you need someone to speak to, reach out."

When I had nothing taking whatever I wanted was easy simply because I had nothing to lose from taking that leap. So instead of hiding from the chaos I used to scream at the universe if that was all it had to dish out to me. And then laugh when it would hit me again.

Accept the challenge with a laugh in your belly and a dirty smirk on your face. I can tell when someone has the capacity for what I like to call the ""devil's smile"". The world can be your oyster but if and only if you accept that fact. 

If the haters start stacking up then you know your doing it right. But if you stop yourself then your outstanding achievement in life will be a collection of ""what if's"". Believe me you don't want to be that person. So take your shot and give them hell. What really do you have to lose?"

Also, excellent choice in shirts--I love those ""sketchy"" style shirts so much, and Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite Renaissance-era Disney films :D

Advice from personal experience ahead (if desired):

&gt;!Putting on weight isn't the end of the world. I struggled to accept my body after I gained weight for a long time, and you know, the people who care about you don't give a single fuck about your appearance. In fact, the extra squish and cuddle is quite nice!!&lt;

&gt;!I learned to talk about my weight like just another descriptor that doesn't matter much. Like, someone can be blonde, tall, short, blue-eyed, or fat. ""Fat"" is just another word and has zero affect on a person's personality. Another thing I learned compounded onto this is that ""fat"" does not mean ""ugly"". You can be big and fucking hot, or adorable, or sweet and cuddly.!&lt;

I'm very happy that you're learning to embrace yourself. You seem like a very sweet person who deserves to love herself. &lt;3"

I'd never really worked out before, so it was the first time I really saw that by putting in time and sustained effort, I could physically improve. And just so you know, it'll take time and effort, but you WILL improve. One day you'll be on a stroll not even thinking about it, and you might tear up a little bit when you realize it isn't a problem anymore.

Anyway, after that I started working out and making other health-conscious choices, but that's not the main part of this story. The MAIN part is that it's an excellent exercise in perseverance, the and it'll change how you view challenges in the future. It's really hard, but I believe in you, and I know you can do it."

I'm honoured my post could help in some way.
The fact you are a warrior, motivator and leader comes from the incredible odds you have overcome, our journey makes us what we are I think.
Some people let past trauma twist them and makes them negative, people like us us it to fuel positivity and we use those experiences to help others.
Speaking as an avid gamer I think that's an amazing idea, games can be many things but for some it can be a means of escape from a harsh reality.
Any good game should illicit emotion and hopefully leave the player with confidence found in the game that can be taken into the real world.
Inspire, motivate and help others and you are doing that, the world needs you right now as it grows darker, colder and unforgiving by the day.
Never stop fighting, never stop inspiring and never change."

It's better to know earlier than later what kind of person they truly are and shows you deserve better. Don't blame your recovery on this either, cheaters are cheaters and they'll do it regardless. Stay positive and good things will come your way man. Wake up and be thankful for what you have and what you could have and you'll achieve it!"
0,rarias89,1601275629,"THANKS FOR FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS. I want to be a teacher myself, thanks for the inspiration. My pops once said to me ""life only throws at us what we can handle so when your in a shitty situation remember: It's bcuz only you have the will to overcome it, no one else"". The way you seem to have handled your babymom/gf is truly one for the playbook, keep on the high road. You come off as a great person so I can only imagine how good you are with your students.

0,CheddarCheezy,1601275100,"Four years is a long time, but think of it this way: you have had four years to mature and figure out what you want from a relationship so you can bring a wholesome, fulfilling life to the person who really deserves you. Please remember that while everything seems to be falling apart there are still people who love you like your friends and family, hobbies and passions for you to return to and thrive at, and a future of endless possibilities ahead of you to create fond memories with countless new people you have yet to bless. Right now you are just in the middle of a bad storm, but always remember that after rain comes a rainbow and even after the darkest of nights the sun always rises.

0,torijackwaffles,1601274364,Don't worry about the weight! honestly just take one day at a time and focus on feeling better the weight will resolve itself eventually and it can't be addressed all in one day. So have patience with your body which is trying to keep you safe! Also learning to love myself with more weight was very liberating! Suddenly it wasn't a dreaded thing anymore! Keep going you are doing beautifully!

It takes a while for people to find themselves and what they want to do. For some a day and others years.

Though his body says, 'Stop!'
His spirit cries, 'Never!""

Keep crying, ""Never!"" my friend. You got this."

Two: Disregard my nerdiness, I just got back from watching Empire Strikes Back at the theater.

Three: Don't fear thirty, you don't look a moment past twenty-three. You're a stone cold 🦊 and you will be well into your 80s. 

Four: I'm sorry you're hurting. It's never easy and there are no words that can heal that wound immediately. Especially when they come on the outset of something that was so dear to you. Still, I hope you find peace enough to restore your joy soon. Just do what you can and every day you'll get closer to something better.

I’ve actually been doing a lot better in the last year in terms of confidence and letting my personality shine. Unfortunately this coincided with a pandemic and I live in a place where there’s not too many like-minded people. As you say, makes meeting other people difficult right now."

Btw being a lil thicc is acceptable/understandable to me when we aren't able to fully access our bodies and require surgery for help. I'm post op too and the bed rest put on some weight. Point is: We are healing! Our bodies are reshaping to a New Normal for us. Healing takes time that we have to better us.

I am very, very sorry about your cat. That is an enormous amount of pain I am sure you are feeling, and carrying that pain can be very lonely because well...there is only one you who knows how you feel.

0,animatr_,1601236790,"Tinder only shows the image that is portrayed. You can’t show your true looks, personality or all of your positives. Don’t let matches dictate how attractive you believe you are. You are amazing and social media doesn’t dictate that. There are methods to getting matches and a way to navigate through it that has nothing to do with your pictures or bio. So never think you are not enough fam"

0,WavvyBoi,1601226886,"It’s the same with women for me.  I’ve dated countless people, no luck.  For a while I was wondering if there was something wrong with me, but I realized that you can’t force a relationship.  So at this point, I’m just trying to do my own thing.  It’s tough sometimes, especially now with COVID, but I figure that there is someone out there for all of us.  Just remind yourself that your enough and don’t beat yourself up.  When your feeling down, do something you enjoy, treat yourself to a nice meal, go for a walk.  Works for me, may work for you.  Cheers."

0,notreallyswiss,1601224057,"As a fellow ginger, I send you a warm ginger hug.  You look sunny and bright and like you are a great friend to those you care about."
0,notreallyswiss,1601223913,"You are so lovely, anyone who doesn’t want to be liked by you, just by looking at you must not be sensible.  Anyway, if you think about it you don’t WANT everyone to like you.  There are sadly a lot of idiots and jerks in the world.  It’s better to be liked and loved by only the people you truly care about.  Who cares about the rest?  They are missing whatever it is that allows them to appreciate you.  

If you feel a need for generalized approval I wonder if you have ever thought about being an actor.  You are certainly great to look at!  And being in a situation where a lot of people who don’t know you are interested in what you say and do while you are playing a role might fill the need to be liked by a lot of people unconditionally. You have an expressive face and eyes.  I think you might be good at it.  And the standard rejection that all actors routinely go through might help you to care less about what other people think of you.  Even the best or most stunning actors are not right for every part."
0,tworedangels,1601223672,She will be ok. She can join pirate kitty subreddit when she’s all healed up. We love all our kitties!
0,Oso_Del_Cielo,1601223533,Hell yeah! Potatoes hurt when weaponized! You got the right idea!
0,notreallyswiss,1601223036,"I’m awfully sorry everything seems difficult right now.  It’s a very good sign that you are reaching out for help, even from reddit.  We all need a little pick up sometime but a lot of people just try to get through it alone.  Just know, there will be days when you will feel joy.   As someone who has suffered periods of severe and long term depression in my life, I know what I am talking about. There really will be wonderful times for you.  It is recognizing where you are and working with whatever that circumstance is that makes the better times possible.  I know you’ll get through it even if you don’t believe that right now.  

You have everything within you to get through whatever this is.  Don’t stop trying - laugh when you can, smile a little even if you don’t feel like it (there is evidence that just smiling - whether you feel like it or not - sends a positive signal to the brain about your mood - and that can make you happier), go for a walk, get enough sleep - these things sound trivial but they are the building blocks of a happy life and they are definitely things you can and should do for yourself.  I’m rooting for you."
0,goboxey,1601222829,He's probably already done with you too. Hence the lukewarm apology.
0,Nahareeli,1601222693,"Either way, I'm done with him."
0,goboxey,1601222139,Yes that's correct. As I said before I think he doesn't see it as a serious friendship. Or he probably has a weak character trait that prevents him from understanding the true value of a friendship.
0,croissantmachine,1601222068,wow guys!! When I went to bed last night I was not expecting to wake up to this! Thank you so much for the support and love. I am not sure I can reply to every comment but I have read them all and I've read many of them to Keeks as well:) it means so much to me!
0,Nahareeli,1601222033,He lied to me and admitted it when I called him out on it. So I wouldn't say so. He just doesn't respond when I try to talk it through. He's not good at anything emotional but I think when you lie and get caught you have to live with others being angry and disappointed in you

0,DystopicLasagna,1601219813,"Remember, this is your life; live it for yourself, not for others. Work on improving yourself and embracing your gifts, and you'll automatically attract the right people for you. Don't bother about what most of the populace tell you, as they're ignorant and aren't worth the effort of convincing. Fewer close friends are far better than several superficial ones.

0,LadyBroAlex,1601217338,"Keekers,  you a brave girl!  You’re absolutely beautiful and you’re going to do so well!   

I know how it is to love a pet with health scares.  I had a cat who had a seizure problem for 3 years before she passed away this month.  She never let it bother her, and she still had the same personality all 17 years of her life.  She was attached at the hip to me, and she even helped me adjust to my first apartment the last few weeks of her life. 

I commend Keekers for going through with this, as any major surgery is scary.  But it means a lot that an owner cares enough to go through with the things she needs, even if it’s difficult.  I can tell she’s loved, and that’ll make a difference.  All the best, sweet Keekers!  Good luck on the surgery and here’s hope for a speedy recovery!"

0,cheyenne_ayesha,1601205911,The new additions seem very good. That was last season. We’ve played 3 games this season and played  much better football than the end of last season. Actually our defence wasn’t the best last season and the Leeds game is just one game so you can’t base too much off of that yet. We often take a while to get in the gist of things defensively and sometimes attacking wise too. City don’t exactly have a world class defence either. I have faith in us to do it again but it will be close.
0,Winstonwal,1601205534,"I think the people you’ve bought will put you in a better position, but since lockdown you’ve not quite looked the same team, you look more likely to concede goals this season as proven by Leeds, and I think that’s what will cost you. I think as it stands we will probably finish outside the top 4, unless we can get rid of Woodward who is useless when it comes to buying people. Our defence is awful 🙄😂"

YOU ARE : someone who is so unbelievably strong that they broke, and didn't repeat, an abuse cycle; Are facing struggle and strife from it but have chosen to face it through instead of running from it and, although I don't know the whole picture, I am sure you have been instrumental in helping the abuse come to light and probably saving or lessening damage to others. 

You're already pure strength for loving after hateful acts  and, no matter the outcome from here, you've put yourself on an amazing path. Be very very proud of what you've become. You bloomed like a fucking redwood from the ashes and shit. Stay you."

0,Dweebdruh,1601178402,"Wow this brings back some good memories.

 When was a kid I got a little kitten from my grandparents ranch in AR and her name was Keiker. I don't even know where the name came from, random gibberish from me or my little brother or if she had another name and it somehow got changed, but honestly never thought I would ever see another cat with the same name haha. She came back with us to florida that summer and then back to the natural state when we moved there around the time I was in highschool. She passed away laying in her favorite sun spot at about 14, nearly a decade ago now. 

 I'm sorry your girl is having health problems,  she is really beautiful and sounds like a wonderful companion, wishing the best to both of you!"
0,TheM-AConundrum,1601178310,"Dear friend, if your worth is derived from what others think of you, you will always come up short. Why let others dictate whether you are likeable or not? Set your own standard and work toward it. Many things are variable, so don't expect a sudden or solid change. Please be kind to yourself, treat everyone around you with compassion, and one day you'll realize you're not so bad. Don't give up, friend. We're all rooting for you!"
0,croissantmachine,1601178079,"Thank you! she looks so elegant and sophisticated, but at the same time is a goofy clutz that talks endlessly, it's a wonderful combination. 

and that's ok, I am sad and nervous about the surgery but was honestly relieved, as the initial guess before additional vets and testing was that it was cancer. Now I know that it can be solved by removing her eye, it doesn't completely explain her other issues (i.e. occasional but complete inability to walk for up to 4 days at a time) but they might (?) be related, only time will tell. One step at a time"
0,CriticalMemory,1601177942,"Your worth does come from others.  It comes from yourself.  Let's put this in another way that may make more sense -- you're doing this in reverse.  You cannot truly connect with others until you like, trust, believe and even love yourself.   Now the question you have to ask yourself is why you don't trust you yet?"
0,Shame-nigg_pp0,1601177777,No giving up. Nah uh! You'll understand everything at a point and from there it will be smooth. Idk about Java but Set theory and Logic become easy over time and you'll find it very useful too. Just hang on.
0,croissantmachine,1601177638,"best decision I ever made. She was part of the ""lonely hearts club"" at my local shelter which is for pets who have been waiting over 2 months for their new home.

0,roo_oo_oor,1601177395,"Yeah depression really sucks, there's often no rhyme or reason to it and just when you think it's lifted it can come and kick you down again out of nowhere. Even though I can't make it go away I'm with you in spirit and I hope that hearing other people struggle with it too and that they're with you helps you get through the days a little. What I will also say is that your beard is looking great, you really suit it."
0,roo_oo_oor,1601177143,"You sound like you have the perfect philosophy and resolve, I'm so impressed by that. Keep on keeping on, make sure you keep in contact with your tutors so they know where you're at and that you're not gonna give up on it, you've got this. If you can end a day and say you tried your best, that's something to be incredibly proud of yourself for, so make sure you give yourself a toast every night when you wind down. Every day you keep trying, you get a little better. You're doing great. Keep going."
0,roo_oo_oor,1601176760,Feeling anxious is so completely understandable but you've got this. Adrenaline will carry you through your first few days and I have every faith that you'll soon be so engrossed in it that the nerves will fade fast. Best of luck and congrats on this exciting new chapter!

It's the logo of my favourite artist (his name is EDEN), and the words (Running, Tripping, Falling) are from an unreleased track of his (which he'll probably never release).
His music means a lot to me. :')"

I'm forgetting the name of the woman, but recall a discovery made by a woman in this field earlier in the year, and her comments about the challenges of working as a rare woman in the field.  Hoping this triggers someones memory better than mine.  Point being, male dominated fields can be challenging -- as a man who champions and encourages bringing women into my own field, do not let men control your narrative.  If you're going into this field, you're obviously already brilliant.  Find people who believe in you and what you bring to the profession.  Good hunting!"

0,Sodokios,1601132265,"Hey, we could have the whole world tell you that you're great, amazing, beautiful, sexy and even craved but it wouldn't matter if you don't believe in yourself or don't love yourself.

Depression is a mean thing and I would know, I'm on high medication.

You should start by writing down your emotions, then understand what is bothering you. Let say it's your current social circle, fix it then and understand why it needs to be fixed.

I always tell people to be alone for a good month and only write things, it helps since writing is communicating with yourself.

Go for what you want and life will get better. You could be a beautiful model but there's bound to be people who hate models, perfection is a myth but you're the only one who can be you.

In a way you're unique, so grab life by its ear and whisper what you want. Find calm environment reset your brain.

Problems come and go and if you have a positive view on life they turn into lessons.

You have yourself a good day, you can do it."

My mom stayed with my dad despite being unhappy and I never knew what a healthy relationship looked like.

I don’t need to build a relationship with someone new, I’m going to build a healthy relationship with my son and with myself."

0,Nesmai,1601084490,This one is my fav. But it is mostly by choice at this point
0,notfromsliders,1601084309,"You may be 31, but you are remarkably beautiful and youthful. Your 31 is like the 30’s actresses that portray college-aged teens on a CW drama; like Gilmore Girls or The Vampire Diaries. You have nothing to worry about. ☺️"

0,HelpfulAndHope,1601083855,Yeah I mean over txt but that’s not bad. Nothing is worse than “K” or a “...”. Lol
0,BEauty0003,1601083548,"Sorry things have been hard. Hope things start looking up soon!

My 4yo is super into random facts these days, so here's a random fact inspired by your user name to cheer you up: 

Did you know that in 2018 scientists discovered a preserved pup that was 18,000 years old and is thought to be a common ancestor to both dogs and wolves? Dubbed ""Dogor,"" he is so well preserved you can even still see his whiskers!"
0,notfromsliders,1601083424,"It is a fact that you are a gorgeous woman. You look like an actress or hair model just off of set, however, I know flattery isn’t going to help on days where you are lonely, exhausted and struggling. It feels nice but it doesn’t always hit the lonely we all feel at times. 

I too have Aspergers. I don’t know what all you suffer from, but my greatest issues are social. Just talking face-to-face with others, socializing and picking up verbal cues. I’m a odd duck that has issues being myself around others. It’s why I often prefer to text. It’s very isolating at times. I doubt you have something exactly like that, but I’m sure there are some parallels. 

It is a toast, so I am proud of you for putting yourself out there. Your post had to take a good bit of thought and courage. Exposing your insecurities and feelings to the world isn’t always the easiest thing to do. I’m rooting for you! 

Hopefully, you might feel less lonely knowing that you aren’t alone. I have gone through all the emotions you mentioned before, and I made it through it. I can say from personal experience the only two things that help me are service work and loving self. Not advice necessarily, I’ve been down that hole before. It’s nice to have a friend to show you how to climb out. 🙂"

0,Duck_Stereo,1601056608,"That honestly takes so much courage and dedication, you should be *extremely* proud of yourself. Starting anything new is difficult (especially during a pandemic), but you’ve put in enough effort to feel the effects already, that shows what a great and caring person you are. People are depending on you, and you’re giving it everything you have. You’re doing an excellent job, I’m jealous of your constitution and dedication."

People won't necessarily know that you're not 100% confident, and even if they see it or suspect it, they'll respect the effort and try to meet it. Plus I've found that acting like you know what's up kind of helps to fool you too, so you get a little boost even if you're feeling nervous."

It may be scary, and hard, but there will be a resolution where you are better for having taken on this difficult situation and doing your part. You are doing this not only for yourself, but the people around you. Your heart is in the right place. And as much as you may feel that it’s going out of your control, things may find a harmony you didn’t expect. You’re playing your role for compassion, and it’s a gift you’re giving. So much respect, you are awesome"

I grew up in a community where we shouldn't be depressed because we still have limbs, shelter, and food. Relatives have questioned if I had concrete reasons to feel sad. 

Anyways thank you for the very very kind words. You have a beautiful soul and I wish things would be good for you too ❤️"

The first few months will be rough but do not blame yourself for anything nor for being a human.

I prefer the you today because you went through hell and will come back out of it as stronger viking!

You know more of what you want in your life and life will reward you with the most amazing partner.

Imagine how the one will be like, you were with someone that wasn't the one and happy, the one my guy will turn you from a Viking to God of War Kratos.

Live day by day and be positive and happy you are alive.

From personal experience. This event will make you happier than you were because now your love is all yours and once you know how love yourself you will elevate your potential.

0,ProfBlossom,1601044851,"I won't come out and say that everything is fine and dandy, and that your situation doesn't suck. You have a right to feel hurt due to the experience with your friend. I also know how that kind of lonelyness feels like; you seem like a genderswitched version of myself in a way. I am sending virtual hugs your way in case you need it. 

That being said, don't let these negative feelings hold you back for too long. Take a little bit of time to recover emotionally if necessary. But then, my advise to you is to make plans to put yourself out there, socially speaking. As other posts have pointed out, you are a beautiful young woman that many men would be delighted to be dating. If you hadn't old us that you never had a relationship before, I would NEVER have guessed. Based on just this one picture, I can point out numerous features that I find very attractive, most notably your eyes and your hands. These compliments won't necessarily improve your current loneliness, but I hope it inspires you to believe in your own self-worth. It's more likely that you can achieve your goals if you convince every fibre of your being that you truly deserve it. We are here to tell you that you really do."

And maybe practice on not letting hags like that, step on you. My bet is she does it, because she looks at you as an easy target. Maybe if she threatens you again. You answer her with a loud but humble ""did you just say you're gonna slap me?"" So everybody can hear. Or if she calls you anything bad, maybe ask loud again ""Did you just call me a [insert insult here]"". But then again, it works best when there are witnesses around.
Or maybe take a voice recording if you're alone with her, and use that as evidence."

0,icantdeciderightnow,1601037339,"Please tell me you have documentation, witnesses and proof. At the very least, you will need witnesses of this behaviour who are willing to stand alongside you. 

Be prepared to get pushed out if your job, micromanaged, put under a performance review etc. This is how people deal with whistleblowers. They don’t like the boat being rocked, rather than dealing with the issues and perpetrators, they usually go after the victim(s). 

Can you get work insurance? Have been to visit your doctor yet? This will assist in any work cover claims you may consider taking down the track if this has been effecting you health and mental wellbeing. It might be worth consulting your union if you’re part of one. I personally didn’t find mine useful, they were a waste of money. Because I joined after the bullying (similar situation to yours) started, and naively told them this. So, they chose not to help me.

I think you're awesome for being here.  You seem fiercely ready to make a change.  As for crying,  men we all need a good cry.   Earn your A without idiots.  If you're not able to do it alone, be direct with your professor and ask to be moved immediately. 

Now for the human...  be good to yourself.  Take a break and dont be afraid to pause for reflection.  That face in the pic is deserving of kindness and patience and doesnt seem like you're getting much.

Treat others like they're gold.  Learn compassion a d people will seek you out.  Don't be too vain to see how beautiful the world can be.  At your age, I was angry and jaded.

Loving someone without getting it in return is a setup of your mind.  You deserve to be released of that harnessing pain but I know it comes back when you're weak.  I've been there.  People tell you advice because they care and the only loving thing I can do is give you the reality that you need to live a life without that person in it.  Sure she's your friend...but your relationship with yourself is completely at odds and there's hope somewhere in you that her relationship will change.  You deserve more than that...you deserve to release her and allow the love you still have for her to be given to someone who seeks only your attention.   Tough words since I had to face them myself. 

It's so horrible to be young and worthy of new relationships during the pandemic.  You seem like an amazing dude honestly and tons of ladies would love a guy like you..so give them a man who is truly free to give his heart to... free yourself.  No more reminders of a relationship which is no longer yours.  

You're worth every word that I wrote here.  You're still defining your pain within your post.

You're out of one relationship...so build a new one where you're worth isnt defined by your partner but with yourself!  You have beautiful strong face and more hair that I can ever grow! I'm damned envious! 

Honestly,  you're fresh out of a relationship and you're feeling that loss.  Allow yourself time to heal. You're wondering about your faults instead of focusing on why you're effing awesome!  Why? You have everything you need to move past your past.  Is it a tough time right now with the pandemic? YES! But we're all in need of valued support,  so you're not alone! So take next steps and get motivated to focus on positive pathways! You will have more challenges ahead and the more positive you are, the more boyfriends you find because those POSITIVE people are beacons . Become one and people will be drawn to you.

Giving them hope for taking next steps in a truthful manner is so super meaningful ...not just to that young man, but all of us who are always improving.

You're listening to cruel people in your past because you're 22 now! You're not a teen and you shouldn't be living in the past! If you hangout with vampires,  you eventually become one. Make positive choices and cut all forms of negativity as you're able.  


HAPPY BIRTHDAY  you wonderful human!  Learn to love everything about you! Tomorrow is a day you star to control your future image.  Please read Meditations by Marcus Auriellus,  or study the art of  understanding you have a higher purpose here and that your beauty doesnt come from other people, it come naturally from loving the amazing person you need to be! 

Have you ever been appreciated?   It feels so good to get that praise!  You learn WHY people love you.  This comes from service to the lifes of others .  Do good things and life rewards you for the compassion and empathy you reward others.  Stop hanging with negative people and you will find positive folks if you go to positive places.

 Every word here is a birthday gift.  They are written for you, not just mine but EACH REDDITOR  who loves this forum.  These are representative of the people you find who understand life is so painful that we've crossed those bridges ourselves and we found our humanity on the other side.

When you need to be reminded of the lovely person you are, we are here.  Compassion happens. Start changing your life and kill one problem per day as a start.  You have a prayer from me to heaven on the way....it's there to bless your path."
0,Ankerjorgensen,1601026468,"Eyyyy man good on you for not taking that shit. The ole' live on your feet, die on your knees thing is a cliché for a reason. Your quality of life is a lot better when you don't let yourself be stepped on by other people."

0,TheProtobabe,1600977272,"You are the most beautiful person I've ever seen at a hospital. Seriously how are you doing that I always look like shit lmao.

Hardships suck. This year sucks. Illness sucks. And it's not discounting the suffering you went through to acknowledge how much stronger you are to be able to endure and survive. You could've given up or refused hospital care or use your illness to be a victim, but you didn't.

Someone is looking up to you and learning how to be strong in the real sense--to ask for help and take care of yourself even when it's hard. Some kid at the hospital or someone you know in your family or a friend will look at you and aspire to be that.

God seriously though your skin is flawless."
0,Bjslld_6,1600977068,"Doesn’t look bad at all. 

Braces are super normal to have now. I got braces almost 20 years ago and they were already pretty common. My friends and I would get excited about the different color choices for the rubber bands. They have become less expensive since then so they are more common now. They are still a bit of a financial status symbol since not everyone who could benefit from them have the financial means to get them. 

Your smile looks great!"
0,aang44,1600976973,"You are such an inspiration to me. My health has also held me back for a while and it still sort of does.

Sometimes we identify ourselves as a ""sick"" person, but when I have achievements (in work and school) I remember that I am much more than my illnesses and it makes me feel like I grow and I advance as a person. Keep in mind that you *are* not a ""sick person"". You are a person, and you *have* a disease. Little changes in vocabulary can make a big change in our mental health.

We do things people around us do (work, school), but we carry a heavier backpack. That heightens our value, it doesn't lower it. You're a goddamn superhero, don't forget that."

Maybe you helped her by acting as a stepping stone. Maybe. Being a good person doesn't always pay off, but look at the possible good you've spread into the world because of your actions. Just because she may not be with you, it doesn't mean you shouldn't eventually become happy for her and encourage whatever she may be doing. It's difficult, yes, but letting go of the ego is one of the best things you can do in life.

With love from Indiana."

On a side note, don't let yourself go down a wrong path. You be you, and mark your goals, and keep your head on the prize. Going through school clean-handed and being the best you you can be is what matters most.

0,Lcommie,1600971044,"Hey luv. I know how difficult it can be to get out of this psyche, hell, even I haven't gotten out of it and I still struggle. Always remember; when feel like you hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up. Learn new things. Read, write, dabble into anything that piques your interest, basically anything that makes you feel like life is worth living.
I used to consider myself a nihilist, but now, — if I had to label myself because I detest using concrete labels — I'd call myself an absurdist. It's a stream of philosophy that states that there may or may not be meaning to life, but we should still live it the way we want to, by attaching whatever personal meaning we associate with life. It's the search for answers in an answerless world. Jean Sartre said something along the lines of, ""the meaning of life is anything you do that keeps you from killing yourself"", and personally, that's resonated a lot with me.
You can do this, I believe in you. You're so young still! And you seem like a beautiful person, even though I don't know you. Always remember you aren't alone, I know it can get difficult sometimes. Maybe penning down your thoughts might help you."

One day you’ll be with someone great and won’t be wondering about how it will all go.  You’ll be living it.  Until then you’ll inspire others because of the choices you make and reaching out for support along the way.  Sharing these things with us is super helpful.

0,that-is-a-ad,1600965852,"I've been in groups like that, in these moments I remember the wise words of one of my favorite professors, ""Sometimes you will have to work with selfish or not so smart people, they will turn down everything good you come upon with even if they don't have a better solution for the problem themselves. The key is to start seeding your ideas into their sub consciousness, and let them believe that they have come up with the idea/solution. Its not ideal, but necessary for the collective success of the project"". But don't condone their behavior if they're just big bullies, bullies need to be taught a lesson.

There's the physical part done.
Mentally it seems like you're incredibly strong. I stalked your page for a minute, you know, like a creep. I've read bits and pieces of your story and I'm thoroughly inspired and encouraged by you.

0,mmbahcat,1600959020,Don't be embarrassed! I appreciate the kind words all the same. I've had things to over my head many times. It's sweet that you didn't consider death an option. I think that says you're optimistic and you obviously care about others. That's nothing to be embarrassed about.

Cheers to you, yo."
0,Mous3_,1600958530,"Tbh. I did, but it was more horrifying than anything else. Im not really religious but have some loose pagan beliefs.

 It felt like I was dreaming, I remember being under an intense white light, my ears ringing so hard it was more buzzing than anything else. I felt like I was being ""tested"" to see if i was worthy of something...but for what I couldnt say. I was unable to move, but felt like I was surrounded by people...or more *things* than people, chattering to one another but i couldn't make out more than a few words like ""they involuntarily jerk sometimes"" ect.

 And pain. I was in agony, and time didn't seem to exist. I felt like I was floating, but whatever these things were doing were keeping me weighed down. After what felt like hundreds of years the buzzing in my ears increased, the light got brighter and it felt like I was falling at an incredible speed before everything went black. 

 Next thing I knew I'd come to in the ER with all sorts of tubes and machines hooked up to me.

 I'll also say this because I've had a few friends that have died and they all experiences different things before coming back - my experience was unique to me, and after hearing the details from those friends whod come back it does seem different for everyone.

 Going through that and coming back though... the air smells crisper, the sun a little brighter, the breeze more comforting. Its like my senses right now are sharper than they ever were, and my appreciation for life is far greater now than ever before.

 I feel for you, and wish you a speedy recovery but I can't counsel you in something like belief because that's a very personal and individual thing. All I can say is dont be disheartened by your belief or lack thereof. Just take your time, and do your best to experience things as best you can in your own way. Either the belief will come or it won't. Its nothing to worry about."

0,OranguPanda,1600955837,"Hey man, work is the least important thing in your life. Yes, you may spend 1/3 of your days on the job. Yes, you may spend 40+ hours a week there. And that's an unfortunate corner we've backed ourselves into as a society, but as Bob Ross said “Gotta have opposites, light and dark and dark and light, in painting. It’s like in life. Gotta have a little sadness once in a while so you know when the good times come.”

Work may not be as dramatic as this sounds, but you are so not a quitter for wanting to take care of yourself first. You, your family, and your life — the way you choose to live it — are all that matter.

You can manage that heart condition. It may be tough at times, especially when the garlic bread steam tickles your nose like in the cartoons, but you can do it. My grandpa had 2 heart attacks and a triple bypass (and he's just a skinny little dude). He's still kicking and with it, and he'll be 97 in 2 weeks. 

Your heart condition won't define your life's path because you won't let it. 

Also I'm DMing you a pic of my cat.

Stay strong buddy."

But I also see you've mentioned a handful of things that you possibly will not be able to do in the future. You see, I have realized recently that there are so many things out there, just waiting to be lived and explored and you might not even know it yet. The constraints you have right now will limit those ""yet unknown and inexperienced"" things but they will certainly exist. So I wish you have certain things you look forward to. And if there aren't any, find them. That's my philosophy. To get through life, have some things you look forward to in the future. We might not quite agree to this. But I really just hope you find your peace and happiness.

But you don’t.  It’ll take a lot more than this disease to slow you down. You have so much to give , so much to do , so many lives to touch , so many people to make happy that you continue.  You should feel good about yourself because you have a lot going for you. If others can’t accept you for who you are or what you’re  going through that’s on them. The world is full of  jerks.

Case in point - from the media perspective, Ellen Degeneres is a flaming bitch.  What nobody’s talking about is her frontline championing of the LGBTQ community and the millions (multiple) of dollars she’s given to charitable donations and individuals over the years to make a positive impact in the world.  

IS she a bitch?  Possibly.  But if so, she’s a bitch who’s done a whole lot of good in her lifetime.

Rely on those couple of friends, I keep my friend circle small and believe me, it's more than enough! Having even just two or three REALLY good friends makes all the difference.

0,DoYouWantCokeOrPepsi,1600944814,"Checked your profile and i must say you got some 3D modeling skills my guy. I would say do more of that if  that is what you have lost interest in. Maybe do different things like 3D animation or interior design? As a graphic designer myself i know what its like to lose interest/motivation, it sucks and you feel like shit. But trust me, what you make is definetly something that a lot of people want to see more of. If I were you, I would make an Instagram account and post work there, it helps reminding you how much you have worked and reminds you that you have actually worked hard. Sorry if this was a little too much, just trying to help :)"

0,TheCrackedmask,1600940188,"Wow... *Applause* It's rare I meet any true warriors in this world but you are truly an exception.

To be able to do all that and with Crohn's is beyond impressive and now here you are in the place I'm most afraid of (Hospital) and you are still fighting like a warrior.

You have a determination, a fire in you if you will and again that's rare.

You should become a motivational speaker, or someone who can teach others to never give up, whether you realise it or not you phenomenal, a force of nature and that in itself you should be proud of.

I have no doubt you will be back on your feet in no time.
It might knock you down but it certainly can't keep you there.

Keep fighting it because you are a warrior and never let the illness extinguish that light in you because it's brighter than you know.

You got this, rest easy, heal up and know you are far from defeated."

If she’s toxic, it sounds to me like you’ve got out just in time, even if it is painful. Toxic relationships can be so difficult especially because they can be like vicious cycles that seem impossible to get out of, but you have won that battle and are now one step closer to your next chapter in your life and that is so positive for you! You’re having a low time, but this will help strengthen you and you will come out of this fighting. Those of us who struggle have so much to offer the world, and the world has so much to offer us.

0,thatscifiwriterguy,1600932392,"You are *not* a quitter. Whenever we are handed difficult news like a diagnosis, it takes time to process it and come to terms with what it means for us. Something that requires us to change how our life is lived is the hardest news of all; we're creatures of habit, we humans, and we often don't like having change thrust upon us. There's a period of adjustment, both physical and psychological. It's not easy and it takes time, but you'll reach your new normal. Having trouble coming to grips with it doesn't mean you're a quitter; it means you're human. 

One of the greatest, most important aspects of humanity is empathy. To understand the difficulties of another and to show compassion. Clearly, this is something your supervisor never figured out and their life is so much the poorer for it. If they decide to push the issue, know that you have recourse and options, and that there are laws and regulations that will help and protect you. Ultimately, the rude words of one heartless supervisor are something safely ignored; your health and wellbeing are more important, and the people who know and love you will always be on your side. 

You have the strength to get through this. I know that at this point things still seem very unsure and scary, but you have strength and fortitude even you aren't aware of yet. There is nothing wrong with crying, there is no shame in acknowledging fear and worry. But they are temporary, and you are stronger and more resilient than they are. The panic will subside, and you'll face tomorrow with courage and grace. You're not alone, and you're stronger than the difficulties before you. Your smile will return, and the clouds you see today will blow away. Brighter days are ahead.

No matter what, believe in yourself. Know that you are the one and only, singular, spectacular you, the only person in this world who can be you. And you are wonderful."

By the time your ex is divorced (for the first time), you will be feeling better. 

I can tell you, as a woman, you are very handsome. Your eyes are lovely. I can also see you're a writer. I bet you have a romantic and sensitive heart. 

As each second passes, you become closer to meeting the love of your life. You've either already met her (exciting!), or you have yet to lay eyes on her for the first time. 

Either way, I imagine a beautiful woman running her hands through your hair as you read her some poetry.

Putting that aside, I agree with those who commented above me. You are very lucky to be free from a toxic relationship(sometimes it doesn't feel that way, especially watching them carry on with their lives, but you have ultimately set yourself up for a happier and safer life). Just try to focus on yourself(also easier said than done)! These are unprecedented times we are living in, so it is imperative to give yourself a break and a pat on the back. Focus on surrounding yourself with people and hobbies that make you happy and everything else will fall in line. It seems like a long uphill battle sometimes, but the view from the top will make the climb worth it."

Singledom is awesome. Gives you time to focus on yourself. You are the most important thing right now. Own it. Singledom has a tendency to end when you're enjoying it, anyway.

Poor health and unemployment suck, but they're a temporary state that does not define you as a person. You're going to get through this.

You're a likeable person, and fwiw, not bad looking either. Snooping around in your profile, you're smart and have an interesting mind. Particularly enjoyed your book recommendation posts. I'm also bookmarking the post you wrote in January wondering what lay ahead in 2020, because dang it's been crazy."

Also don't put that much emphasis on pictures. Sure they may look cool as hell but they are also planned and most of the time it's made to hide the default/ugliness.
Idk how old you are but focus on tommorow. For example, think about who you want to be and do your best to reach that. If you wanna be fit ? Go hit the gym and look at the progress you made, don't mind complimenting yourself even on small details.
Don't focus too much on how you are now but think about how you will be later!"

Your story gives me hope!"

0,algentle,1600921208,"Been sick for 10 years? Can you elaborate? I think you are better than average for sure. Once you feel better and can give a smile to yourself in the mirror to boost confidence, I think you’d knock it out of the park, 10/10."

0,Clumsy_Throw-Away,1600918886,"I'm glad you like it! But I completely understand where you're coming from. I'm not a very attractive guy at all -- I'm distastefully skinny, I'm just flat out weird by most people's standards, and I've got a huge nose and long neck. I wouldn't mind as much but I know that people will treat you how they feel you look; judging you solely from those looks rather than personality. I hate seeing the obvious discomfort in people's faces, body language, and even hearing it in their speech because I of all people am talking to them.

 I think the easiest way I've found to cope with this is to find you some really really good friends who aren't going to let you fall down and not help you get back up again. It's so much easier to disregard how people treat me because I know I don't need anyone but the friends I've got. I think from this reply alone, you are FAR more than decent to talk to! I really really hope you and I both are able to see something we find attractive about ourselves. Take care man :))"
0,DystopicLasagna,1600918532,"I love this comment! I was attempting to smile, but wasn't sure how far to stretch it before it looked too cheesy. At any rate, I'm glad you liked it. I like to think that I'm a pretty decent person to talk to, but unfortunately the first impression is the most lasting one, and I rarely set very good first impressions. I know that most of the world isn't like that, but it just sucks knowing that I'll be judged for my looks by most people around me. Thank you so much for your advice though, I feel a lot better about myself now."
0,LillyTheElf,1600918480,Get it homie
0,princessemmababie,1600918341,Yay!!!! You are so beautiful wow!!!
0,DystopicLasagna,1600917831,"That's some very good advice that I try to follow almost always. I understand that things like beauty are only superficial and shouldn't be such a huge problem, but it occasionally gets to me and makes me feel bad about myself (even more so when I come across a friend's pic and look at how picture perfect they seem.) You're right though, it all depends on how much I respect myself.

That's a really good proverb, by the way. Mind if I steal it?"

0,IIArioseII,1600916449,That's beautiful....even I have a dream of opening of a small school in some rural area
0,DuhBearsGuy,1600916290,"Dad type here kiddo, who’s been around and seen some life over the years.  Here’s some things I’ve learned...

1) Life is a wheel that never stops turning.  As a part of that wheel, sometimes you’re on top - sometimes you’re at the bottom.  The thing to keep in mind is the wheel never stops turning... and when you’re at the bottom there’s only one way to go from there right?  

The trick is to never get too high when you’re on top and never get too low when you’re on the bottom because it’s going to change, I promise.  So chin up!  Better days are coming, and they’ll be here sooner than you think. 

2) Sir Winston Churchill, shortly after World War Two, gave the best college graduation speech I’ve ever heard of.  He walked to the podium, and the students were enraptured.  Here was a living legend, who had led his nation to an impossible victory through the most horrible war the world had ever seen - and he was about to share his secrets to success with them!

Churchill cleared his throat, and said “Never, ever, ever, ever, ever give up.” - nodded once to the crowd, and walked offstage. 😳

Shared that to say this... expounding on Mr. Churchill’s wisdom, if you do the right things the right way for the right reason?  If you use that as your guiding principle, success isn’t an IF - it’s a WHEN.  May not be today, might not be tomorrow.  Might not be next week.  But I promise you that if you keep grinding at whatever you’re doing with that mindset, you WILL win eventually... and more often than not, you’ll win sooner rather than later. 👍

So get those applications out there, bunches of em.  Update your resume and get that out there too.  Do some research on interview tips and tricks to polish up those skills while you’re waiting for the calls to come.  When they do, read up on the companies you’re going to interview with and know some stuff about them before you walk through the door. All stuff you can do right now, so you’re ready when the opportunity comes. 

And don’t forget to come back and tell us when you get the win! 😊 We are suckers for a success story.

You’ve got this kid - now go get it! 💪"

People who mock others are resentful of the light. They cannot shine, so they seek to dim what light they do see. We are a disappointing species sometimes. You don’t deserve any of the feelings you are expressing. You are a regular dude in a sea of regular dudes. But you see, even the regular dude is a miracle in a cosmos full of mystery. So in this way, I don’t just see you as beautiful. Much more, you are no less than a miracle. I hope you can find the opportunity and people conducive to your life goals. Not all people suck."

0,huai21,1600906804,"One of the things my dad told me after I told him about getting sexually harassed by my cousin at 10 years old is 'there are many more victims of rape, what's the big deal?'

Growing up with my parents and close relatives, all I been hearing is to suck it up and be an adult. I don't know if I'm too weak for my family because they are strong enough to 'suck it up'. But my sadness were invalidated, and it hurts to hear that from my dad (though we were never close) 

Thanks, I'm not good in opening up, but my dad's sentence hurt me gravely, I just wanted to vent out something. Maybe talking the people around the world would help myself.

0,basmati_relish_trail,1600905054,"The desert was rough, the heat was unbearable. The visible poverty in Al Quasais really upset me, especially as just a few miles onward past DXB and you were in the lap of luxury on Sheikh Zayed Rd. It wasn’t lost on me that it was the poor migrant labourers in Al Q. that made that all possible. But they’re hidden away from the tourists and those who only experience picture post card Dubai. But I know kitchen trade is rife there so you’ll learn lots that will benefit you for the rest of your life and career, so it’s smart. I tried to stick around but I just didn’t have the will power. McGettingans was always a quiet little place, I felt comfortable there. I also liked Belgium Beer Cafe in Festival City for that reason. I went to Barasti in JBR once ... that traumatised me for a week. I don’t know why I got so adventurous out there, it was completely uncharacteristic. Stay safe out there, put yourself first and remember to drink water."

I’m sorry that you’re still there, I really didn’t like it. Unless of course you love it, then good for you! Is McGettigans near DWTC still open? I used to spend half my time wishing life away alone with one too many drinks in there, and all the senseless drunk dancing by myself to the house musicians. It was singularly one of the most depressing periods of my life."

Galicia is great! Spain in general but I haven’t lived anywhere else but here and Pamplona"

0,peterjonesracing,1600894236,"I can kinda understand this. I (16) recently moved over 100 miles from my house. I know it's quite a jump from 100 to 2000, and I go home every weekend, but as a teenager living away from home for the very first tie, I see why it can be difficult. 

I haven't made many friends either. But maybe the reason we can't find friends yet is because the world is saving up the special ones, rights?

Hang in there, you'll work things out, and you'll be better than OK"
0,The_Duchess_of_Dork,1600893972,Galicia is wonderful. My mother is from there and I love visiting my family of Gallegos! I hope your life there is as beautiful as your hair and smile! ¡Buena suerte! You got this
0,Clumsy_Throw-Away,1600893864,"Sometimes I'm afraid to comment because I feel like my words just aren't as sweet as some people's, but please believe me when I tell you that everything is going to be fine. I'm sure it seems like this is some pointless bandaid and that I'm just saying it because I have no other words. But I mean it.

 I know this isn't about me, and I'm not going to rant on and on, but I've been in some REALLY dark places and I understand 110% how you feel. I'm sure our circumstances may be different, but even when I felt like it couldn't get any better than how I felt at the time, eventually it did. You are so incredibly strong, and your eyes are absolutely beautiful! I know when this is over you're going to be a lot more resilient, but just know that you're very important, and even though it might not seem like much, people love you and care for you a LOT.

I'm always here for you, you're more than welcome to PM me any time you'd like! But I hope one day you can look back on this all and realize just how far you've come. I really hope today is better than the last, and I honestly hope every day will be better than the previous. You've got this!"

0,Clumsy_Throw-Away,1600893316,"Dude you are a bombshell. I'm sorry that I can't tell if you're smiling in this, but it appears that you are, and your face definetly made me smile. I've actually been mocked the majority of my life for my body weight as well, so I'm right there with ya, but I can promise you that you're beautiful -- and don't let anyone else, not even yourself, tell you otherwise

You have awesome hair, a great skin-tone, and you seem to be very charismatic! I think that in and of itself is awesome! I'm really glad you had the confidence to post, because that's a great first step. Be strong, stay safe, and everyone who has nothing better to do than criticize you for something so trivial can stick their words right up their ass!"
0,Clumsy_Throw-Away,1600892674,"You are indeed the first! I do see the resemblance as well, but I have a very big afro that I tied back and slipped through the back of the hat I was wearing (in the picture with my profile, it's barely visible, but there's a big puff ball coming from the back of my head hahahahaha) 

I'm glad you think I'm good looking though! It does really feel great to hear that, especially from someone so sweet! I actually used to have rectangular glasses but they're beat up and it was time for some new ones :)) 

Hopefully I do age well! I'm glad I quit smoking, it was a cheap and easy out for all the mental trench warfare I was going through about a year or so ago, but thank you so much for your kind words! I hope you have an amazing day ❤"

You’ll finish school, you’ll move out and it’ll be completely your choice if you ever see your stepdad again, and you’ll look back and realize that you’ve made it, and you’re ok.

Your parents failed you when you needed them, but it sounds like you’re being your own best ally right now- you’ve taken the steps necessary to start finding the right treatment, and it’s only a matter of time now before all the puzzle pieces fit together the right way.

I’m so sorry that you suffered a panic attack yesterday. I can only imagine how exhausted you must be today. Looking at you, I would never have guessed you’re just now recovering from such a rough day - you are *so* pretty, and you have the look of an indie movie heroine about you. You look as though your journey isn’t going to be like everyone else’s, because you’re not like everyone else. It’s going to be epic, and I wouldn’t be surprised if one day someone told you that you should write a book about it. Hang in there and you’ll be glad you did. &lt;3"
0,CallseverybodyDude,1600891574,"I feel your intense pain, my friend. I lost my sister in an accident when we were teens and my dad to cancer in my 20s. They happened 10 years apart, I can’t imagine having lost them just months apart. I’m so sorry for your losses. 

The only advice I can give is to just keep moving. Getting out of bed is 95% of the battle. Keep on doing just that and you will emerge stronger, with a deeper grasp on life and you’ll be someone that people will admire and look to when their time of suffering comes. 

It’s going to hurt. And it’s ok to hurt. That just means you love them and they loved you. It will get better. One day you’ll think of them and smile without the pain. Realizing that you’re grateful for the time and memories you shared with them, not just furious for the time that was cut short.  It’s a journey, but you will find these happy days down the road. 

Times of tragedy let you know who your real friends are. The real ones prop you up and do what they can to keep you moving. This tragedy might’ve been a blessing in disguise when it comes to your fiancé. Better for her to split now and save you the pain of when she disappoints you later. 

Dude, sorry for the novel length reply but you hit me in the heart strings. My heart aches for you. Know there will be a better time ahead. Be strong for yourself and your family. Let yourself cry. Find a good grief counselor (this changed my life). And keep moving. 

Best of luck to you brother."
0,Adzm0g,1600890915,"I invented this proverb few days ago:  
"" Unlike the Earth, you should keep getting hotter every day! ""  
It probably don't mean anything for you right now but keep going! Keep trying! Fix yourself goals and go for them because you're WORTH IT!  
Also don't try to just make people like you, unless you like yourself! You are important, don't forget it. Focus on yourslef!  
For the beauty part, just dress as you like, put clothes that you love and why not try to look for clothing advice. For example which shirt to put with my favorite jean etc.  
IMO beauty is a weird concept because someone may dress badly but if he loves himself and the way he look he may make people feel like he is handsome even tho he should seems ugly to a certain ""standard"".  
Work on you, not on the way people look at you!"

It’s a bit of a long story. I don’t have my dream job yet. Honestly. 

Quiero presentarme a las opos de secundaria, para ser profe de inglés. Todo este tiempo he trabajado de auxiliar (primero con un programa de beca y ahora en un concertado). Hace unos años hice el máster (antiguo CAP), luego saqué el Celga 4 de GALEGO y el carné de conducir. Ahora estoy esperando mi equivalencia de título, eso es a lo que refería con los papeles. Acabo de mandar todo por tercera vez, que el ministerio me mando 3 “incompletos.” Es un desastre aquí...ya sabes.

Everyday we are bombarded by social media, TV, billboards and magazines telling us what is considered to be beautiful....truth is it's bullshit.

Some people might be attracted to the people in those images but on the whole beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Many people and I imagine especially those with BDD look in the mirror and just pick out every flaw.
Instead spend some time in the mirror looking at all the good, positive things.

Firstly you took a picture of yourself and posted it here which took courage in itself and that's an amazing step forward.

Beauty can found inside and out, firstly realise you are amazing as you are and nobody can tell you otherwise and eventually learn to love all the best parts of yourself.
One day you'll look in a mirror and realise that woman staring back at you has been amazing all along."

0,dumdumts,1600879419,"It is sad that there are so many people out there who mock others for their looks. It messes with your head and makes you look at yourself differently than you actually are. I can assure you that you look fine. From the picture you don't seem that overweight (not skinny, but totally fine and healthy). You don't look like Chris Hemsworth (I mean, almost nobody does), but you are not ugly either. You look like a nice approachable guy. Don't ever listen to people who bully you for your looks, they do it regardless of how attractive you are, because they are assholes, and it has nothing to do with how you actually look."

I hope whatever you do in life is is in a positive image and you truly get recognized for your efforts in what you put your mind towards. :)

Have an absolutely wonderful rest of your day and even your life too! You rock man!"
0,TheCrackedmask,1600876519,"Firstly sorry your hurting, having someone suddenly end a relationship out of nowhere is a pain that hurts like no other.

Now will be a bewildering time and you will lost for a while but eventually in time being lost in the recesses of your own mind you will find yourself again.

When you do come out the other side you will realise that as much as you loved him he wasn't right for you and clearly didn't deserve you 

Eventually someone worthy of your love will come along and when he does this will be nothing but a bump in the road to someone who will treasure every minute with you.

Your heart might feel broken right now but eventually it will heal and you will find someone who you make you brave enough to let someone else into it again.

Hang in their, trust that one day you will give your heart to someone who will never let it go."

I have reacted multiple times to you aver the last few months, hoping you believed me when I told you you were beautiful. And each picture you posts confirms that thought of mine, but it does not matter what I believe. You will need to believe it for yourself.

I urge you to reach further than the help we can offer you. Help in person can help you overcome your fears and believes, more than us on repeat.  
I hope that one day you will believe us when we call you beautiful and more importantly, start seeing it yourself!

I’m sure there is definitely the positive aspect of having a cool new place that you’re able to settle in to. I was looking to move for a while prior to COVID but things are so uncertain now that I’m a bit risk averse. It’s good that you have your diagnosis at your age, I was in my mid 20s before I figured it out. It can be tough knowing but at the same time it makes a lot of things easier to understand exactly why we do the things we do, and feel the things we feel. I’m wishing you all the best and lots of strength, I’m sure you have a very bright future ahead of you. Don’t worry about the life experience, that will come."

I think you've definitely got a folksy sort of beauty/style going for you and that you would look super pretty if you refined it!  If you're 13 you've got *years* to grow into yourself -- try different styles, have fun and don't let your ""friends"" get you down.  

I think people can be really mean and judgemental at 13 -- it's a tough age, and it isn't one where you should be drawing those sorts of conclusions.  Looking back on those sorts of years, myself, I can safely say most people that comment on appearance are insecure. It's really just a matter of figuring out styles that work for you - one's that you like, enjoy, respect and own."

1. You're doing your bit to stop the spread of Covid to them and their loved ones by not going in. 
2. This is going to seem like a weird silver lining, but the fact that you got fired *and are going to fight for your rights* means that they will in turn know *their* rights should they be in the same situation you're in now. It's hard being a trailblazer, but folks will respect you for it, and those who don't aren't worth *your* respect.

A conscientious employee is something any employer should be absolutely stoked to have, and you are exactly that. Whether you go back to this job or not, standing up for yourself and your colleagues is a trait that will get you positions in better workplaces in better jobs. Principles are important, and you clearly have them, which is something to be proud of!

You're young, and you're bold, and it's going to take you so many places. Keep your head up and keep going: you're making a difference now, and if you want to, you can make an even bigger difference in the years to come.

If you go for it and put a lot in then you can really get a lot out of it! Guaranteed there will be people there into the same stuff as you, just gotta find them. PS your glasses are fly"
0,babycthulhu4,1600837626,Thank you for being a responsible and considerate person. It absolutely sucks that your boss is a dick but you get the satisfaction that you are a good person and by not going in you could have saved someone’s life.

0,EllaShue,1600836082,"When you are in the middle of grief, it sometimes feels as though you will never smile again. And yet you do, inevitably. Joy is as much of a natural state for us as sorrow, and we return to it even after great pain.  You have experienced more than your share of it, but you have something that a lot of people who have endured much don't: a willingness to look forward to the time when smiling and laughter come easily to you again. 

 If you weren't hopeful, you wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be trying to hold it together. That hope will be rewarded with better days. 

I'm so sorry for your losses.You have a great deal of resilience, or you would not be here to hear some kind words."

0,DuhBearsGuy,1600829027,"Hey young lady! 😊 49m here with some encouragement and kudos for you.

1) I’m a firm believer in this, because I’ve seen it again and again over the years... when you do the right things the right way for the right reasons, wins arent an IF, they’re a WHEN.  Karma is real, and you scored a ton of it here with your integrity.  

2) It might sound cliche, but here’s another one I’ve seen lots over the years - one door closes, another one opens.  Only shit organizations terminate good people for doing the right things.  Quality people are VERY hard to find, and quality companies snap them up every chance they get.  You’re going to land in a much better job situation, you just wait and see if I’m not right. 😊

One last thing, and it’s something folks don’t hear often enough anymore - for whatever it’s worth, I’m very proud of you. 👍"

0,And-Lo,1600819087,"In all serious though, in my own personal experience there are certain things which either change naturally over time (such as new energy suddenly appearing in you to make friends or do things you enjoy) or you have to eventually force yourself to do those things so that your body and mind (hopefully) adapt to doing them. It’s like a new habit, it takes an excruciating amount of effort and hard work and refusal to give in to giving up but eventually when you do adapt then it’s easy peasy. If you’re capable of working full-time and living independently this stuff will be peanuts for you before long! And the feeling of finding and hanging out with someone you like can itself become a kind of energy generator for you. Also coffee after work is good if you like that sort of thing

But really I think most people in your position would feel exactly the same way as you and be too tired at the end of the day to do anything else."

0,TheThinMint,1600819011,"I was fired from my job last week for the same reason. As soon as I knew I'd been exposed I called my employer and got tested, but it wasn't enough for those assholes. 

I was really upset for a few days, blaming myself, and then I realized a few things. My boss has set an example now, so good luck getting anyone else to be transparent with him. In the immediate aftermath of my conversation with the company most of my co-workers all turned on me, and I know that even if they were to offer me my job back I wouldn't want to be around that anymore. Lastly, I know I did the right thing. I know through my test results that the chance I exposed my co-workers is low, and one of my coworkers has a vulnerable child who surely doesn't deserve that, no matter if his dad is a dick.

You did the right thing. Sometimes the right thing isn't rewarded. Move on to people who respect you, value you, and see the good you do."

0,AndrogynousRain,1600817715,"I quite understand. I’ve been there. I’m also on the spectrum. It is really hard. But don’t give up. Here’s the thing:

We get taught we’re weird. Different. Less than. We don’t fit. So we break ourselves into shards and pieces trying to be normal to fit in. It’s exhausting. I used to feel the same. 

Then one day I realized that the issue wasn’t the fact that I’m different, it was that I had been convinced I was ‘less than’. 

So I embraced who I was. It was a process. But the more I just accepted who I was, the more I stopped apologizing and started liking myself, the less of my day was taken up be beating myself up in my head. Suddenly, I had the attention freed up to pay attention, learn social stuff, and grow. 

15 years later I’m happily married, have a great job, like my life and myself, and have done a bunch of things I never though I would. 

You are human. Just a different kind. One that has less patience for social bullshit, and fake nonsense and a hunger for what’s true. Your emotions are powerful but work differently than others. 

It doesn’t make you less than, it makes you YOU. And that person is far stronger, and of far more worth, than you realize yet. 

But you will."

I have just one comment and one piece of advice: that necklace is lit, and don’t sweat the big things. You’ve got plenty of time ahead of you, so try not to worry too much about the “adult things” just yet (choosing a career, etc.). Just take it slow and don’t be afraid to branch out whenever the opportunity presents itself. You’ll do just fine, kid. ✌🏻"

0,acari_,1600816439,&gt;you can always try to get internet friends to talk to this way you can have more control of when you can turn off the computer or not if you are tired and take a rest. If you make friends online it will lessen the hardship of making friends irl (i guess).

Chin up, hon. Things will turn around 🥂"
0,reddeaddaytrader,1600816321,"This is probably not well worded as im worn out from the day, but I think the key points i meant to say were just to be aware of how you feel, like ya said, and use that against the Bad Feeling, you know? Knowledge of yourself makes a helluva good bit of ammo to win your head's war, and that goes whether its mental illness, a career, or really anything, ive found."
0,basmati_relish_trail,1600816264,"That sounds like a great career to pursue, good for you. Imagine all the people you’re going to bring joy to with your pastry. I think your advice is great and something I definitely need to work on. It’s tough for me because I’m working solidly to keep my independence and roof over my head currently, sadly that means that by the time I’m done for the day I’m so drained I can barely find energy to make myself a meal let alone make a friend. I get by and do my errands but other than the mundane stuff I really struggle to live a meaningful life. I’d love to find my people and break free from this constant state of burn out, but I’m afraid I’d be a terrible friend because I’m a solitary creature by nature, no matter how much I try to fight it, and I can’t help but go through long periods of needing to be alone just in order to focus on coping. So I want both worlds which doesn’t work well and I feel guilt for letting people down when I disappear. I have one person I’d consider my close friend who I’ve kept in touch with since college but even we only speak infrequently just to check in. I also have moved a lot with different jobs and education so I don’t really feel I have a true home anywhere. But you are right, I really need to take a hold of my life or nothing will get better. Thank you again for your encouragement and faith"
0,reddeaddaytrader,1600816197,"Thanks back at ya for doing the same, love. Awareness is absolutely key: before understanding I had bpd all I thought was 'im crazy and no one can tell me whats wrong with me.' After learning it, and spending time with just me and time with others going through everything.. Its easier. I know when im splitting, mostly, and I know when im idolizing someone or when my emotions aren't real. 

There are still days I feel like glass, or like I dont really exist at all. But those days pass. 

Just keep that gorgeous head up, yeah? Youve got this, badass."

0,heliumguy,1600807886,You did the right thing!
0,thatscifiwriterguy,1600807804,"Imposter syndrome is a psychological state where someone doubts their competence at a job, their value to it, and whether their accomplishments and recognition are actually earned or just a matter of luck. Basically, no matter how much someone has achieved or how good they are at what they do, they feel like they're a fraud even though they can be (and frequently *are*) highly capable. It also appears in a psychological care setting, where someone with depression or anxiety feels that their feelings and pain aren't significant, that they're not really in pain, and they aren't worthy or deserving of treatment. 

It's equally common between both women and men, and tends to affect more capable people more frequently. People experiencing imposter syndrome typically have a difficult time accepting or believing positive feedback and focus on what they see as flaws in their work far more than accomplishments and successes."

0,thephuckedone,1600803424,"Damn thats not right. You did the right thing, don't feel bad. 


I'm currently on the owners shit list at my job because a gm at another store got covid and he want me to drive over there and work with a bunch of obviously exposed people. 

I told him no. My mom is 60+ years old with immune system problems. On top of that im a smoker which would not help me if I got it. 

I already work at two stores 60 hours a week, but because I said no that makes me a ""bad"" employee. 

I wouldnt be able to work at all if I was sick. I still can get another job if I'm not sick."

Of course, if I knew your personality and backstory a bit better I’d be able to help you out more, but regarding the people who call you names and make fun of you, they’re doing it for either Internet clout or pride in themselves. I know it’s hard to believe that what they’re saying is unimportant in some cases, but it truly is. If they’re just trolling, simply ignore them. Friendly Criticism should always be welcome, but for those who just want a rise out of you, matter no more than the words they say."

0,Hairosmith,1600802409,"Don’t listen to them. They’re just jealous. They don’t deserve a second thought. The only person you need to please is yourself. I know it’s easier said than done. After years of bullying and an emotionally abusive ex husband I have very little self esteem. But I realized something. People are mean because they’re unhappy with themselves and their lives. They saw something in me that made them jealous and want to bring me down. They were threatened by me in some way. I’m a kind, caring person. I’m beautiful on the inside, and that makes me beautiful on the outside too. 

You are beautiful. Inside and out. Don’t let anyone, especially your own mind tell you different.  You are more beautiful than anyone who has ever made you feel bad about yourself because you don’t need to do that to feel good."

0,TheProtobabe,1600801179,"Thanks for being a good person and choosing to keep others safe. Thank you for being selfless and enduring backlash that affects your way of life so people don't suffer from this virus. It's truly awful and I don't think enough people are aware of HOW awful it is; it suffocates you, makes your body hurt like the worst flu you've ever had, you get full-body rashes that hurt just to brush against, you're feverish and delirious, your hair falls out, you cough so much that you pull rib muscles but you can't stop, and in a lot of cases there's the possibility of being put on a ventilator which I wouldn't wish on anyone. Even young people who caught COVID sometimes end up with trashed lungs, permanently.

But you know how bad it is. You kept people from it. You kept families healthy. You kept your coworkers healthy. And, even though they may not deserve it, you saved your managers from the virus, too.

You are the kind of person who gives me hope for the future of the world. Seriously, not saying that to be hokey. It's comforting to know that, even among loud arguments against plain scientific fact, even when family members and managers try to tempt you to ignore exposure possibilities and symptoms to be near them and other people, even when there's so much propaganda surrounding something as simple as wearing a mask, you will do the right thing. And that there are more like you. Thank you for doing your part to make the world safer and happier."

Depending on where you work though, if it’s a chain or decent sized company I recommend going over your boss’s head and making sure people higher up know that what they did. Especially if they tried to convince you coming in knowing you were exposed before firing you - they are endangering their employees and any customers at that location and being extremely reckless. The people above him need to be aware of his behavior and it could possibly even lead to an offer of getting your job back at another location. But if nothing else, it could help prevent others from being endangered by this boss’s behavior."
